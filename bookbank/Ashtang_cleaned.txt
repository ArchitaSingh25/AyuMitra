Vagbhata Sutra (4:36)Vagbhata Sutra (4:36) Foreword Ragadirogan satatanusaktanasesakayaprasrtanasesan; Autsukyamoharatidanjaghana yo'purvavaidyaya namo'astu tasmai.It was really a pleasure to review and to write a few words as foreword on the press copy of the book Astanga Hrdaya : Sutrasthana' authored by Dr. R. Vidyanath. The book comprises of the text and the translation with detailed comments and updated information on different aspects which are very useful for the present generation of readership today. The efforts to add the botanical names and photographsof many medicinal plants to provide useful lead to correlate the same with the classical Sanskrit names are commendable. The designed diagrams of some surgical instruments and certain treatment procedures are really interesting particularly in the context of the study of a Samhita Grantha. This effort obviously adopts the message of Vagbhata himself who stated at the very outset of Astanga Sahgraha, that this treatise is being created to make Ayurveda Sastra yuganurupa.The language of the write up and the overall presentation of the book is easy to go through for a maiden reader. The entire approach appears critical and creative exercising adequate care to conserve the originality of the book and its contemporary readability. I hope this new addition to the contemporary Ayurvedic literature will benefit the students and teachers of Ayurveda in pursuing the subject in a right perspective.right perspective. Astanga Hrdaya is an important classic text of great educational significance as it is prescribed as a text book for graduate students in view of its easy accessibility and because it is a better organized text than the Astanga Sahgraha. The galaxy of Foundation texts of Ayurveda comprise of two sets of authentic texts fondly called 1. Brhattrayl and 2. Laghutrayi. Brhattrayl texts are 1. Caraka Samhita, 2. Susruta Samhita and 3. TheSarhhitas of Vagbhata (Saiigraha and Hrdaya). Most often the Astanga Hrdaya is counted among the Brhattrayl, not so often the Astanga Sahgraha. However many scholars believe that Astanga Sahgraha is the prime text of Vagbhata. The Laghutrayi texts are 1. Madhava Nidana (900 AD), 2. Sarngadhara Samhita (1300 AD) and 3. Bhavaprakasa (1600 AD). The historians consider the Brhattrayl texts, especially Caraka and Susruta, as the pre Christian texts while Laghutrayi are the medieval texts.In Indian historical traditions there have been several scholars holding the name of Vagbhata. The famous Ayurvedic texts Astanga Sahgraha and Astanga Hrdaya are also authored by the one or the other Vagbhata. Vagbhata represents the golden age of the Indian history, i.e. Gupta period and hence it gives a literary glimpse of the Ayurvedic tradition and cultural status of that period in India. There has been a controversy where the author of Astanga Sahgraha and Astanga Hrdaya is the sameVagbhata or they are two different persons. However, considering many facts, it is largely believed that they were two different persons and the two treatises were written in two different periods of history by two different authors.(vi)There are controversies about the period of Vagbhata. It seems the author of the Astahga Sangraha, Vagbhata's time was somewhere between the period of Vatsyayana (500 AD) and Varahamihira (600 AD). Vatsyayana was an expert of Kamasastra while Varahamihira dealt with another branch of knowledge viz. Jyotisa and Vagbhata was a physician, besides being an erudite poet. The Vagbhata's classics are largely the collection and codification of facts discovered through the works of AgnivesaCaraka, and Susruta Nagarjuna and their contemporaries, besides certain new ideas and facts to update the knowledge which seems to be the theme of Vagbhata as is evident by his own statement in the text:Yuganurupasandarbho vibhagena karisyate. (Vagbhata Su. 1:20) Hcfd lU Md: WT: W ciH SgHWilg: I Sarvatantranyatahprayah samhrtya'stangasangrahah; Asthanavistaraksepah punaruktadivarjitah. (Vagbhata Su. 1:18)It seems Astahga Hrdaya was compiled by another author later in order to make the subject more concise and easy to handle. The author of Astahga Sangraha is believed to have greater impact of Buddhism as is evident by author's own omissions to Buddha. The critical comparative study of the two texts in terms of the impact of earlier classics like Caraka and Susruta, it is believed that AstahgaSangraha has more Caraka's impact while Astahga Hrdaya carries an impact of Susruta. The style and approach of the two texts becomes obvious if one compares the depth and girth of the two texts. Astahga Sangraha has 150 chapters and Astahga Hrdaya has 120 chapters displayed in different divisions as described in the following table which reflects the preferential inclusion and exclusion ofthe subject matter and the size of the texts. It will be interesting to undertake a critical comparative study of all the Sarhhitas in relation to the period of compilation and the reason of such differences.Sthana Bhela Caraka Kasyapa Susruta Vagbhata Vagbhata (A.Sah.)

Astanga Sangraha is the leading text of Sarigraha style which incorporates the subject matter from different Tantras and reproduces the same in a summarized form with greater clarity, while Astanga Hrdaya adopts different style. Further it is obvious that ancient classics like Caraka and Susruta deliberated more on the fundamental and philosophic aspects of the subject while the later texts diverted them from philosophy towards practical aspects.The present volume under publication by Dr. R. Vidyanath presently limits itself to the Sutra Sthana of Astanga Hrdaya which contains 30 chapters namely 1. Ayuskamlya, 2. Dinacarya, 3. Rtucarya, 4. Roganutpadanlya, 5. Drava dravya Vijnanlya, 6.

Tarpana putapaka vidhi, 25. Yantra vidhi, 26. Sastra vidhi, 27. Siravyadha vidhi, 28. Salyaharana vidhi, 29. Sastrakarma vidhi, 30. Ksara agnikarma vidhi. Each of these 30 chapters have been presented in this volume with original Sanskrit text followed bydescriptive interpretation and author's reader friendly comments in a lucid style, not caring critically about the mere literary translation. He follows an illustrated style of presentation taking help of a number of photographs and diagrams for the purpose of comparative study in the present day perspective especially about medicinal plants, blunt and sharp surgical instruments and certaintherapeutic procedures. However, the authenticity of these illustrations will have to be validated and verified in subsequent editions of this book after inputs from the readers. Summarily, this book is a student friendly scholarly work of great value. This is an important addition to the contemporary literature in Ayurveda. I have known the author of this book Dr. Vidyanath for many years. He is an erudite scholar of Ayurveda and is an activist and an enthusiast in his field. Icongratulate the author for this good work and wish this publication a grand success.fa tmieT: f efmre": I Wfft" TftrTJ: eR J f lehfrHrl II Nidane madhavah sresthah sutrasthane tu vagbhatah; Sarire susrutah proktah carakastu cikitsite. Prof. R.H.Singh Distinguished Professor Department of Kayachikitsa, IMS, BHU, Varanasi Formerly Professor Head Dean Faculty of Ayurveda, BHU Vice Chancellor, RAU Jodhpur Jan.10,2013 PREFACEDuring the ancient times, Acaryas of Ayurveda had written voluminous works on different specialties, which were not tangible to mediocre students. So, the time demanded in writing concise books, which cover the essentials of all the eight branches of Ayurveda. Vagbhata was the first person who composed a treatise entitled Astanga Sangraha by bringing together the relevant medical knowledge contained in Caraka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Harita Samhita, Bhela Samhita, Kasyapa Samhita etc.The author himself says "By churning the great ocean of medical science, a great store of nectar by name Astanga Sangraha was obtained. From that store of nectar, a short treatise entitled Astanga Hrdaya was written for the benefit of mediocre students". Acarya Vagbhata was the son of Simhagupta and the grand son of Vagbhata belongs to the region of river Sindhu. His fore fathers were also great scholars of Ayurveda. He was thedisciple of Avalokita, the chief monk of Mahayana Buddhism. Basing on the internal and external evidences the date of Vagbhata can be fixed between 4th and 5' century AD. Astanga Hrdaya is one of the most celebrated and most often studied treatises on Indian Medicine, after Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita. The work significantly begins with an aphoristic preface "What follows is what was said by great sages, Atreya and others." Thiswork generally follows the general plan of Astanga Sangraha and divided into six sections, 120 chapters. The total number of verses is 7120 in the extant edition. Sutra Sthana is the first section contains 30 chapters dealing with Basic principles of Ayurveda, preventive measures, diet and dietetics, classification of diseases and methods of treatments etc. Sarlra Sthana is the second section contains 6 chapters dealing withembryology, anatomy, physiology, physical and psychological constitutions, auspicious and inauspicious dreams and omens, signs of bad prognosis etc. Nidana Sthana is the third section contains 16 chapters dealing with etiological factors, signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and prognosis of important diseases etc. Cikitsa Sthana is the fourth section contains 22 chapters dealing with the line of treatment of various diseases including pathyapathya. Kalpa SiddhiSthana is the fifth section contains 6 chapters dealing with formulations and methods pertaining to elimination therapy, management of complications, principles of pharmacy etc. Uttara Tantra is the sixth section contains 40 chapters dealing with the remaining seven branches of Ayurveda. This work has as many as 37 commentaries, the largest number for any early medical classics. It has been translated into many languages viz. Tibetan, Arabic, German etc. In the Tibetancanon, Tangyur (8 AD) is included a translation of this work along with Caraka Samhita and(ix) Susruta Samhita. It was also translated into Arabic about the same time under orders from Baghdad Caliphs. Another translation was available into German, which was taken up by Luise Hilgenburg Wilibald Kirfel. The following is the list of commentaries available on Astanga Hrdaya either fully or partially. 1. Sarvanga Sundara by Aruna Datta (1200 AD) was edited by Vijaya Ratna Sena Gupta, Calcutta in the year 1888, and by Anna Moreswara Kunte, Bombay in the year 1889.2. Ayurveda Rasayana by Hemadri (1271 1309) was edited by Hari Sastri Paradakara, Nirnayasagar Press, Bombay in the year 1939. 3. Padartha Candrika by Candranandana (10th Cent. AD) 4. Hrdaya Bodhika by Sridasa Pandita (14lhCent. AD) 5. Nidana Cintamani by Todaramalla(14'h Cent. 15' AD) 6. Tattwa Bodhaby Sivadasa Sena (15,hCent. AD) 7. VagbhataMandana by BhattaNarahari (15th Cent.

Another compilation of technical terms used in this work is Astanga Hrdaya Kosa by Valapad K.M. Vaidya (1936). Early editions of this work: 1. Anna Moreswara Kunte (1880) 2. JivanandaVidyasagara(1882) 3. GanesaSakharamaSarma(1890) 4. G.K. Garde (1891) 5. SarikaradajT Sastri Pade (1900) (Nirnaya Sagar Press, Bombay)Only Sutra Sthana of Astanga Hrdaya was prescribed by CCIM as a one of the subjects in the curriculum of BAMS course in the first profession. As on today sufficient number of Hindi as well as Regional language translations are available in the market. As a teacher of the concerned subject for the past decade, I have identified the necessity of proper study material in English language to cater the needs of freshly joined students of Ayurveda. Keeping this inview I have made an attempt to incorporate the translation of the text along with the related matter compiled from various resources in the form of notes. For a better comprehension, the book is supplemented with full of illustrations. In the annexure the following material is incorporated.1. Important Essay Short Questions 2. Important Slokas to be learnt by heart 3. Table of Weights and Measures 4. Glimpse of Astanga Hrdaya 5. Alphabetical Index of the Herbs mentioned in the book 6. Glossary of Sanskrit Terms (xi)It may not be an exaggeration if I quote that this is the first illustrated book on Ayurvedic Samhitas. Though the present book is primarily written for undergraduate students of Ayurveda, it is hoped that Teachers, P.G. Scholars and General Practitioners would also find it useful as a reference book. Keeping the latest CCIM syllabus 2012 in view, Maulika Siddhanta part has also been incorporated at the end.part has also been incorporated at the end.

Madhavanidana, Sarngadhara Samhita and Bhavaprakasa became popular as Laghutrayh.z. lesser trio. The texts mentioned in greater trio i.e. Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita are called as Akaragranthas. That means they are self authentic where as Astahga Hrdaya can be called as Prakarana grantha i. e., which has been written by quoting the references from other texts. Out of all eight branches of Ayurveda, Maharsi Caraka has been given top priority to Kayacikitsa i.e. general medicine, where as Maharsi Susruta discussed the surgical aspects in detail in his text Susruta Samhita. Keeping this in view Acarya Vagbhata has given equalimportance to all the eight branches and written this present text entitled Astahga Hrdaya. Though various authors have written many a number of commentaries at different periods on Astahga Hrdaya Samhita, Arunadutta's 'Sarvangasundari' and Hemadri's 'Ayurveda Rasayana' are the popular and available commentaries as on today. The text Astahga Hrdaya consists 6 divisions and 120 chapters as under:1. Sutra Sthana : 30 Chapters 2. Sarira Sthana : 6 Chapters 3. Nidana Sthana : 16 Chapters 4. Cikitsa Sthana : 22 Chapters 5. KalpaSthana : 6 Chapters 6. Uttara Tantra : 40 Chapters 120 Chapters In the literature of Ayurveda, four persons were seen by name Vagbhata as under: 1. Vrddha Vagbhata : Author of Astahga Sangraha. 2. Madhya Vagbhata : Known through the commentary'Ratnaprabha' ofNiscalakara. 3. Laghu Vagbhata : Author of Astahga Hrdaya. 4. Rasa Vagbhata : Author of Rasaratna Samuccaya. 2 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthana Vagbhata's Geneological Tree (Vamsa Vrksa) Vrddha Vagbhata 4 Sitiiha Gupta IVrddha Vagbhata 4 Sitiiha Gupta I Laghu Vagbhata By seeing the geneological tree of Vagbhata, it can be observed that the father of Vrddha Vagbhata is Sirhha Gupta and the son of Vrddha Vagbhata is also Siiiiha Gupta which shows the Indian tradition of naming the forefathers name to the grandsons. Mangalacarana: MIlMJII Wddl MTljUylMehliiy dH tll l ill llIn Indian tradition there is a strong belief that for successful completion of any work taken up by them should be preceded by offering prayers to their beloved deity. Similarly Vagbhata also after praying his favorite God only, started writing the text entitled, Astanga Hrdaya. Acarya Vagbhata believed that God is the unique physician who is potential in eliminating all sorts of psychosomatic disorders such as passion, greed, lust, jealousy, anxiety, delusion,dissatisfaction, fever, diarrhoea etc. from this universe and bows his head to that supreme power and prayed that the ongoing work should not get any obstacles.Reasons for Writing the Text: Astanga Hrdaya Due to the short span of life in the present era, it is not possible for the human beings to study the various texts of Ayurvedic literature in detail. So, Vagbhata thought that the acuteness of necessity of the summarized text book which caters the medical needs of the humanity. That may be the reason to compile all the eight branches of Ayurveda from the Ayurvedic texts likeCaraka Saiiihita, Susruta Samhita etc. and arranged the subject matter in a systematic way and presented the comprised, full fledged Ayurvedic text named Astanga Hrdaya to the universe. All the available texts of Ayurveda have been taken into consideration by Acarya Vagbhata and compiled the essence of eight branches of Ayurveda and presented in the form of Astanga Hrdaya, which is neither too abridged nor too elaborated.3 T m I t e N M H : I ffrT W W f U W T l T T : I Atha atah means afterwards after praying the God, Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter named Ayuskamiyam (Quest for Long Life), thus said Atreya and other great sages. Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1 3Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1 3 Ayuskamiya means Ayuh kamebhyah hitah. This chapter is intended to those persons, who desire to have a long life. Both the words 'aum' and 'atha' did come out from the throat of the creator of universe, Lord Brahma initially. So, there is a strong belief that these two words are auspicious. That may be the reason to start the text, Astanga Hrdaya by Vagbhata with the word 'atha Definition of ayu:ftfc 4 HT H'iiHll snft I ft FT H M Mf kiq r l 11 (C.S.Su. 1:41) Life is nothing but the combination of the body, sense organs, mind and soul. As long as these four are combined together life exists. Dharijivitam, nityagam and anubandham are the synonyms of life. Dhari: (kfaft the one that prevents the body from decay. Jlvltam: WTT l frT 4 1 w h i c h keeps alive. Nityagam: 'f T 'TEtSffi' (iflJUw f ra frT) f FT:' which serves as permanent substratum of this body.this body. Anubandham: 'SRsRufa (J iO lP l W O T f t f r T ) stjsrj:' which transmigrates from one body to another. Definition of Ayurveda:' a n f C T f r r l : I' (Sabdakalpadruma) Ayuranena vetti iti Ayurvedah ayu'means life, Veffy"means science or knowledge. The science of life or knowledge of life is known as Ayurveda.Purpose of Ayurveda According to Indian Pliilosophers' view human beings are superior to any other living beings and there are certain aims and objectives for human beings, viz. dharma, artha, kama and moksa. Dharma: Dharma is nothing but to determine the paths of life correctly and what ought to do and what should not be done and also renunciate the deeds which are harmful to others. Artha: Artha means money. Money is definitely essential for human life, but money is not theonly essential thing. Earn money, but not at the cost of others. Select the right path, to earn money and one should not eager to earn. Kama: Kama means desire. One should renunciate the unlawful desires and fulfil the psychosomatic desires by selecting the right path only. Moksa: The ultimate aim of the human beings is to attain moksa.

Ayurveda teaches us how to lead a healthy, happy and long life. Hence the persons who desire to achieve the goals of human life should have faith in the teachings of Ayurveda.

According to this tradition Brahma the creator of the universe having known the immortal and eternal science of Ayurveda in full, taught it to Daksa Prajapati and Daksa taught to Aswins, the vedic Gods of medicine who inturn taught to Indra. All schools of Ayurveda agree with the divine geneology upto Indra, but give different versions regarding the transmission of the science among the mortals.When diseases began troubling the human beings and causing obstacles for the acquisition of purusarthas (i.e. dharma, artha, kama and moksa) sages like Dhanvantari, Bharadwaja, Nimi, Kasyapa and others went to Indra and prayed for the mankind to get relief from different psychosomatic disorders. Then Indra pleased and taught Astanga (eight branches) Ayurveda to the sages. Astanga Ayurveda (Eight Branches of Ayurveda):1. Kaya cikitsa (General Medicine) 2. Bala cikitsa Kaumarabhrtya (Pediatrics) 3. Graha cikitsa Bhuta vidya(Demonology) 4. Urdhvahga Salakya cikitsaiE. N. T. Ophthalmology) 5. Salya cikitsa (Surgery) 6. Damstra cikitsa Agada tantra (Toxicology) 7. Jara Rasayana Geriatrics) 8. VrsaA ajikarana (Aphrodisiacs)The management of diseases depends upon these eight branches i.e. Astanga Ayurveda. The sages having learnt the science and exchanged views among them and taught to their disciples like Agnivesa, Bhela, Jatukarna etc. They inturn wrote treatises and became popular in their names like Agnivesa Samhita, Bhela Samhita etc. In this way Ayurveda transmitted from the creator of the universe to the mortals.

These three dosas keeps the body in the healthy condition when they are in the equilibrium state, and causes diseases in the vitiated state. Notes: These three dosas have been divided into 3 types as: 1. Vrddhi (increased state) 2. Ksaya (decreased state) 3. Samya (balanced or equilibrium state)Both vrddhi and ksaya have been further classified as mild, moderate and severe: 1. Vrddhi : A pa (mild) 4.Ksina : Alpa (mild) 2.Vrddhitara : Madhya moderate) 5.Ksinatara : Madhya(moderate) 3 .Vrddhitama : Utkrsta( severe) 6 .Ksinatama : Utkrsta (severe)Briefly saying there are three dosas only. That means on an elaboration, more than three must be there. Basing on the site and functions of these dosas, they have been further classified as: Five types of vata : Prana, udana, vyana, samana and apana. Five types of pitta : Pacaka, ranjaka, sadhaka, alocaka bhrajaka. Five types of kapha : Kledaka, avalambaka, bodhaka, taipaka and slesaka. This classification has been made only for the practical convenience. Some acaryascategorised the rakta as the 4th dosa basing on the following reasons:1. Sthana (site place) : Yakrt, p 7?a (liver spleen). 2. Laksana (qualities) : Padmalaktuka sannibham indragopa pratikasam. (Color of blood resembles lotus flower, lac and the insect indragopa). 3. Kriya (function) : Supporting life and nourishing thebody. 4. Vikara (diseases) : Visarpa, pliha. 5. Cikitsa(treatment) : Sira vedhana (venesection).By the above reasons blood may be grouped under dosas. But it is not correct because as per the definition of dosa 'rakta' is not vitiating any other dhatus, but itself is being vitiated by the three dosas. So, rakta cannot be called as dosa. Hence the dosas existing in the body are three only. Site of vata, pitta and kapha: oyiRnlift l 117 II Though the three dosas vata, pitta and kapha spreads all over the body, they are found predominantly in the following places:Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana Vata : Below the naval region. Pitta : In between the heart umblicus. Kapha : Above the heart region. Relationship between the dosas and the age, day, night and diet: ciifligUif TtiMi y mwf m': tbm t i Vata, pitta and kapha are predominantly present in the last, middle and first stages of age, day, night and diet respectively. That means Vata is predominantly present in the:1. Last stage of the age Old age 2. Last stage of the day Evening hours 3. Last stage of the night Ending hours of the night 4. Last stage of the diet End of digestion. Pitta is predominantly present in the: 1. Middle stage of the age Middle age 2. Middle stage of the day Midday 3. Middle stage of the night Midnight 4. Middle stage of the diet During the process of digestion. Pitta Kapha Aho Ratri Bhuktanam i Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1 42i Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1 42 Similary kapha is predominant in the: 1. First stage of the age Childhood 2. First stage of the day Morning hours 3. First stage of the night Starting of night hours 4. First stage of the diet Beginning of the digestion. Relationship between agni (power of digestion) dosas: 118 II Basing on the dominancy of tridosas power of digestion has been classified as under: Due to the predominance of1. Vata causes visamagni : Unsteady or erratic digestive activity. 2. Pitta causes tiksnagni : Increased digestive activity. 3. Kapha causes mandagni : Decresed digestive activity. 4. Tridosas causes samagni : Normal digestive activity. Influence of dosas on kostha (Bowels): Jj l H l l r l : TPfcfa I Bowels also having the direct relationship with the dominancy of dosas. Due to the:1. Vafadominancy Krura kostha (hard bowels) 2. Pitta dominancy Mrudu kostha (soft bowels) 3. Kapha dominancy Madhyama kostha (moderate bowels). In the equilibrium state also madhyama kostha (moderate bowels) will be seen.

Description of dhatus and malas: SJTWcr: I W EJIT After that sapta dhatus (seven tissues) and trim alas (three waste products) and their functions have been discussed as under. Seven tissues of the body:1. Rasa dhatu (plasma) 2. Rakta dhatu (blood) 3. Mamsa dhatu (muscle tissue) 4. Medo dhatu (fatty tissue) 5. Asthi dhatu (bony tissue) 6. Majja dhatu (bone marrow) 7. Sukra dhatu (semen, reproductive elements). Three malas: 1. Rasa dhatu 2. Rakta dhatu 3. Mamsa dhatu 12 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthana 6. Majja dhatu 7. Sukra dhatu6. Majja dhatu 7. Sukra dhatu 1. Mutra (urine) 2. Sakrt(faeces) 3. Sveda (sweat). Dhatus are so named because they support the body all through the life and they gets vitiated by the three dosas and are called as dusyas. Malas also gets vitiated by the three dosas, so that they are also included under the category of dusyas. Notes: Functions of the seven tissues:1. Rasa dhatu : Prinana (satisfaction to the mind and nourishing) 2. Rakta dhatu : Jivana(supporting life) 3. Mamsa dhatu : Lepa (covering the body) A.Medodhatu : SneAa (lubrication oleation) 5.Asthidhatu : Dharana (supporting the body) 6. Majja dhatu : Purana (filling the bone cavities) 7. Sukra dhatu : Garbhotpadana (getting pregnancy).These tissues are not only supporting the body but also serves as food to the succeeding tissues. During the process of evolution of tissues, the ingested food is converted into rasa dhatu after the completion of the process of digestion. Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1 13Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1 13 Then rasa dhatu divides into 3 parts as under: First part helps for the construction of the own tissue. Second part will be useful for the nourishment of the succeeding tissue i. e. blood. The third part becomes the waste product. Similarly all the tissues are divided into 3 parts and the second part will be useful for the nourishment of the succeeding tissues. In this way the preceding tissues produces food for the succeeding ones. Vrddhi and ksaya:Tnn : r H O ryyifit: I Due to the ingestion of the food having similar qualities vrddhi (increase) will be taken place in the body and ksaya (decrease) will be seen while taking the opposite qualities of food substances. Notes: Both vrddhi (increase) and ksaya (decrease) are of 3 kinds according to dravya (substance), guna (qualities) and karma (function). 1. Dra vya samanya : Intake of mutton increases the muscle tissue due to the similar substances.2. Guna samanya : Sweet and heavy substances increases kapha dosa due to the similar qualities. 3. Karma samanya : Exercise increases vata dosa by similar action. 4. Dravya visesa : Intake of food prepared by wheat decreases muscle tissue. 5. Guna visesa : Ksara (alkalines) decreases kapha dosa. 6. Karma visesa : Excessive exercises leads kapha ksaya. Rasa: T W : WISMdclUlfrlrfclNUIchHliJefcl: m 4 ( s m r f s m r ' " S T z r n r Is m r f s m r ' " S T z r n r I Rasa is nothing but the taste which is being perceived by the tongue. In Ayurveda 6 tastes have been described as under: 1. Madhura rasa (sweet) 4. Tikta rasa (bitter) 2. Amla rasa (sour) 5. Usana Katu rasa (pungent) 3. Lavanarasa (salt) 6. Kasaya rasa (astringent). These 6 tastes are associated with the substances and having more strength in their preceding order. 14 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthana14 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthana Influence of rasas over dosas: dJll JI m d H P d 511 The first mentioned three tastes of the above i.e. madhura, amla, lavana rasas mitigates vata and increases kapha dosa. While the rest of the three tastes tikta rasa, usana rasa, kasaya rasa mitigates kapha and increases vata dosa.

Those substances are of 3 kinds viz., 1. Samana dravyas : Alleviates dosas 2. Kopana dravyas : Vitiates dhatus 3. Swastha hita : Which maintains the normalcy.Eg. Drugs having sweet in taste, unctuous heaviness in qualities reduces the vitiated vata due to the opposite qualities. Ghrta reduces pitta due to madhura rasa other gunas. Similary, honey reduces kapha due to the astringent taste and dryness. The combination of milk and fish increases the dosas due to the incompability. The food items, which are taking regularly i.e. barley, wheat, salihce, milk etc., are suitable for the maintenance of the positive health.Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1 15 Virva: Virya means potency which exists in a substance. Basing on the dominancy of the qualities of a substance 2 types of virya has been described as 1. usna virya (hot in potency), 2. sita virya cold in potency). Vipaka: fasjTfaMlchl 111 711After the completion of the process of digestion, all the substances (either ausadha dravyas or ahara dravyas) will be converted into one of the 3 tastes viz., sweet, sour or pungent. The process of transformation is called as vipaka. Madhura, lavana rasa dravyas will be converted into madhura vipaka. Amla rasa dra vyas will be converted into amla vipaka. Where as katu, tikta, kasaya rasa dravyas will be converted into katu vipaka, after the completion of the digestion. Guna:completion of the digestion. Guna: In total 41 gunas (qualities) have been enumerated in Ayurveda as under: Artha (5) : Objects of sense organs (indriyartha) sabda (sound), sparsa (touch), rupa (vision), rasa (taste) and gandha(smell) Gurvadi (20) Dra vya guna or dwandwa guna Atmagunas(6) Buddhi (intellect), sukha (happiness), duhkha (misery), iccha (desire), dvesa (hatred) and prayatna (efforts). Paradi guna (10) Para (predominence), apara (subordina tion), yukti (propriety) sankhya (number), samyoga (combination), vibhaga (division), prthaktwa (separation), parimana (measurement), sarhskara (transformation) and abhyasa (repetition).Gurvadiguna: M M R J g t c m K f k K I : E iy i fa : f a M I : 111 811 The above 20 gurvadi gunas are also called as dravya gunas. The respective opposites of :hese gunas are as follows: 1. Guru (heaviness) x Laghu (lightness) 2. Manda (dullness) x Tlksna (sharpness) 3. Hima STta (cold) x Usna (hot) 16 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthana16 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthana 4. Snigdha (unctuousness) x Ruksa (dryness) 5. Slaksna (smooth) x Khara (rough) 6.

Visada (clarity non sliminess) x Picchila (slimness) Along with the above 20 qualities some drugs contain vyavayi and vikasigunas also. Vyavayi: Which spreads all over the body initially and undergoes digestion later. VikasI: Which harms the tissues of the body and causes loosening of the joints. Some acaryas quoted that vyavayi and vikasi dravya are those, which consists sara (mobile) and tiksna (sharpness) gunas respectively. Hetu (Causative factors for diseases):)MI h4uii sOHfafcMlfrlHH : I WU4iAjN J (c ifl 9 II The present verse represents an exposition of causative factors responsible for the production of all most all diseases pertaining to the body and mind. The 3 fold causes are: Insufficient utilisiation (hinayoga), Wrong utilisation (mithyayoga) and Excessive utilisation (atiyoga)of time (kala), objects of the sense organs (indriyarthas) and the activities of the body, mind and speech (karma). Where as the proper utilisation (samyak yoga) of the above factors results in healthy state. Notes: Triskandhas: Ayurveda is based on tri skandhas viz., Hetu skandha (causative factors aetiology) Liriga skandha (signs and symptoms symptomatology) Aushadha skandha (drugs treatment knowledge of therapeutics).Hetu skandha: 1. Kala (time) : Parinama 2. Art ha : Asatmyendriyartha samyoga 3. Karma : Prajnaparadha. Ayuskamiya Adhyaya: 1 17 Hetu skandha Linga skandha Ausadha skandha Asatmendrivartha samvoga: Purvarupa, rupa, Dosa samana, Hinayoga, mithyayoga, upasaya, anupasaya, kopana, swasta hita. atiyoga. samprapti. Prainaparadha: Hinayoga, mithyayoga, atiyoga. Parinama: Jara (ageing), ksut (hunger), pipasa (thirst).Due to the above causative factors dosas gets vitiated and various signs and symptoms will be formed as shown in linga skandha. By selecting the appropriate drugs from ausadha skandha, which brings the vitiated dosas to the normalcy, is one of the aims and objectives of Ayurveda. Kala (Time): Hinayoga : Heat in summer, cold in winter is decreased than the normal condition. Mithyayoga : Cold in summer, and heat in winter.Mithyayoga : Cold in summer, and heat in winter. Atiyoga : More heat in summer and more cold in winter than th,e normal climaticcondition. Artha Indriyartha (Objects of sense organs): Hinayoga : Insufficient utilisation of sense organs. Sabda hearing very low sound not hearing any sound. Sparsa not touching anything. Rupa seeing objects in dimlight. Rasa not tasting. Gandha not smelling. Mithyayoga : Seeing unnatural objects. Hearing harsh, unpleasant sounds. Smelling unpleasant, putrefying smells. Tasting undesirable. Contact of hard, dirty and harmful things.Atiyoga : Seeing very bright objects. Hearing very loud sounds. Smelling powerful pungent smells. Eating large quantities of substances. Touching too much cold and hot substances. a? 18 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthanaa? 18 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthana Karma (Activities of body, mind and speech): Hinayoga: Not doing any activity or doing very little of it physically, mentally or vocally. Mithyayoga: Doing unusual activities like suppression of natural urges, falling from great height etc. Atiyoga: Indulging in activities more than usual like excessive exercises, coitus, riding, talking, thinking etc. Disease health:Disease is nothing but the vitiation of the dosas and their equilibrium state can be termed as health. Classification of disease according to origin: T: 112 Oil According to the origin, diseases can be classified into 2 groups as under: 1. Nija rogas (endogenous) 2. Agantuja rogas (exogenous).Nija rogas: In nija rogas, due to the irregular diet, dietetics and activities, dosas gets vitiated at first and then signs and symptoms of the disease condition will be seen. Agantuja roga: Where as in agantuja rogas due to abhighata (accident) signs and symptoms of the disease will be seen first and then followed the vitiation of the dosas. Receptacles of diseases: elm cw Mwlil KfiiBHtifiifi rr i Both the body and the mind are the receptacles of the diseases. 112 1 ll112 1 ll Sattva, rajas and tamas are the qualities of manas (mind) and can be called as mahagunas. Out of the trigunas, sattva guna being good, is conductive to health, but rajas and tamas are considered as the two dosas of the mind causes the psychological disorders. Rogi roga pariksa: Patient is to be examined by the following methods: 1. Darsanapariksa (inspection), 2. Sparsanapariksa (palpitation), 3. Prasna pariksa( interrogation).

Samprapti (pathogenesis) Types of desa and their relationship with dosas: Here desa denotes two meanings viz. 1. Bhumi (region) 2. Deha (human body)Jahgala desa, anupa and sadharana are of 3 types of regions. In jahgala desa vata dosa is predominantly present and in anupa desa kapha dosa is predominant. Whereas in sadharana desa normalcy of cfc sa5will be seen. Types of kala: 1124 II Kala (time) is divided into two kinds: 1. Ksanadikala (moment, second, minute, hour, etc.) 2. Vyadhyavasthakala (6 stages of the disease i.e. satkriya kalas). Types of therapies: TTHJ yiHH H i H i M i f s y i iBriefly saying the therapies are of 2 types as: 1. Sodhana (elimination therapy) 2. Samama (palliative measures)Sodhana: Bringing normalcy of dosas by eliminating the vitiated dosas from the body with the help of the five therapeutic procedures (Pahcakarmas) can be called as sodhana therapy. Samana: To bring normalcy without eliminating the vitiated dosas and simply by adopting the palliative measures can be termed as samana therapy. Out of these two types of treatments sodhana therapy is superior to samana therapy. Becausedosas do at times gets aggravated by adopting palliative measures but there is no chance of relapsation by treating the vitiated dosas with sodhana therapy.20 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthana General line of treatment for psychosomatic disorders: eWH cmTrlci d ' l R J I This verse represents an exposition of the general line of treatment for sariraka and manasika dosas. The best line of treatment for vata, pitta and kapha is vasti (medicated enemata), vireka (purgation therapy) and vamana (emesis) and the best drugs of choice is taila (sesame oil), ghrta (ghee) and madhu (honey) respectively.Dosa Best sodhana therapy Best samana drug 1.

Sattvawan (Strong will): Sattva means manas or mind. Sattvawan means having strong will power. Patients who are having strong will power can tolerate miserable situations also. Though the remaining limbs are equipped with all qualities, it is useless, if the physician is inefficient. But if the physician is efficient, he can manage the treatment even though the other limbs are not equipped with their full qualities.Hence the physician occupies the most important position among the four limbs of treatment by virtue of his knowledge, administrative position and by prescribing capacity.

At the end the sage has enumerated total number of sections and the chapters pertaining to Astanga Hrdaya Samhita.DINACARYA ADHYAYA Daily Regimen3T?Mt f r q f w f TIWPTFT: I ffr ? WlfUtWTt I After ' Ayuskamiya Adhyaya', Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter named 1 Dinacarya (Daily Regimen) thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. Maintain the positive health in the healthy individuals and treating the diseased persons are the two main aims of Ayurveda. Keeping this in view Acarya Vagbhata emphasized the importance of preventive aspect and allocated separate chapters like Dinacarya, Rtucarya etc.Healthy person should have the equilibrium state of the three humors of the body, seven tissues, three waste products and the power of digestion along with pleasant mind, soul and sense organs. Pratahkalotthana (Wakeup time):In order to protect his life, healthy person should get up from the bed in brahma muhurta. Notes: Basing on the above statement it is inferred that unhealthy or diseased person need not wakeup early in the morning and has to follow the Brahma muhurta instructions of the physician concerned. Brahma muhurta is the time, which is second half of the last yama (3 hours) of the night or early hours of the dawn i.e. approximately at about 4.24 A.M.A.M. Arunadatta in his 'Sarvarigasundari' commentary on Astanga Hrdaya it is clearly stated asThat means brahma muhurta is the 14th muhurta kala of the night. One muhurta is equivalent to 48 minutes. Whole night consists 15 muhurtas 15 x 48 720 minutes. Brahma muhurta is the time, which is after the completion of 13 muhurtas in the night time i.e. 13x48 624 minutes. 720 624 96 minutes. Dinacarya Adhyaya : 2 27Dinacarya Adhyaya : 2 27 Hence one has to getup from the bed early in the morning 96 minutes before sunrise i.e. at about 4.24 a.m. It is the suitable time to study and obtain knowledge. It is also the time when all the three dosas are in the equilibrium state. Sauca vidhi (Cleansing): : 111 II: 111 II After considering the condition of the body (such as food taken in the previous night has been fully digested or not etc.), one has to attend for the natural urges and clean the parts well. Notes: Healthy persons should eliminate the natural urges like faeces and urine etc. facing north in the morning hours and south in the night.During defecation one should be silent, sit and cover the head with a cloth. Avoid forceful expulsion. Avoid defecating at dirty places, center of the road, heaps of ash, cowshed, burial ground,sacred places, in front of women and respectable persons, facing sun and moon etc. But at times of fear and sick persons may void the excrements as they wish. At the time of urge, one should not attend any other work. Suppressing the natural urges leads vitiation of vata, which in turn causes many a number of diseases. Danta dhavana (Cleaning the teeth):Twigs useful for cleaning of the teeth: Arka (Calotropis procera) Nyagrodha (Ficus bengalensis) Khadira (Acacea catach u) Karanja (Pongamia pinnata) Kakubha (Terminalia arj'una) and other herbs such as Karavlra(red) (Nerium indicum) Sarja (Vateria indica) Irimeda (Acacia farnesiana) Apamarga (Achyranthus aspera) Malatl Jasminum grandiflorum) Features of twigs useful for brushing: Twigs useful for brushing should have12 inches of length with the circumference of a little finger. 28 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthana Should be straight and devoid of nodes. Collected from sacred places. And also having katu, tikta and kasaya rasas (i.e. pungent, bitter and astringent tastes) are good for brushing. How when to brush? One should brush the teeth early in the morning as well as immediately after having food j without causing pain or injury to the gums. Dinacarya Adhyaya : 2 29Dinacarya Adhyaya : 2 29 Irimeda Apamarga Malati Notes: In Astanga Sangraha, the following procedure is given for brushing the tooth, viz. '3M BH'I f cFT ' Vapya means kustha (Saussurea lappa), trivarga, tritaya means three groups of 3 3 drugs viz: 1. Trikatu (sunthi, marica, pippali) 2. Triphala(haritaki, amalaki, vibhitakT) 3. Trijataka (twak, ela, patrT)Take the fine powders of the above drugs and prepare paste by mixing honey. Then use the paste for brushing the tooth with the help of twigs by rubbing without causing injury to the gums. The lower row of teeth should be brushed initially and then the upper row is to be followed. Kustha Madhu 30 Astanga Hrdav am: Sutra sthana Triphala TrijatakaTriphala Trijataka Twigs having sweet, sour and salt tastes should not be used for brushing. Dry, hallow, putrefied twigs also should not be used. Even though tongue scraping is not mentioned in Astanga Hrdaya, it is clearly stated in Astanga Sahgraha, Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita as under After brushing teeth, scrape the tongue with the help of tongue cleaners, which should not be sharp edged and is curved, made of metals like gold, silver, copper etc.Advantages of tongue scraping: Removes the dirt of the tongue, bad taste and foul smell of tongue, mouth and teeth.

Ksinapada : Take 4 parts of water and boiled then reduced till 3 parts remained. 2. Tribhaga : Water boiled and reduced to l 3rd of the original quantity. 3. Ardhabhaga : Water boiled and reduced till the half of the quantity remained. 4. Kvathita : Water boiled till the boiling point.Water heated by immersing red hot iron balls, gold, silver, mud or bitumen with water, or by exposing to sunlight, either hot or cold, mitigates all the tridosas. Such water is easily digestible and is ideal for samsarga and sannipataja rogas. Boiled water lost the properties of dlpana and pacana and increases all the tridosas, when stored for 2 3 days. Hence boiled water is to be prepared daily and should not be stored.Hot water is also having the similar properties of cold water like sweet in taste and cold in potency. Hence it is advisable to take hot water in thirst and fever. In amajlrna and vistabdha ajlrna also, hot water is advisable. Akasodaka (Antariksajala): It is of 4 types:1. Dhara (rain water) 3. Tausara (water from dew) 2. Ksara (hailstone) 4. Haima (snow water) Out of the 4 types, rainwater is good because it is easily digestible.

Such sedimentation is called madhu sarkara, which is having the similar qualities of honey. Honey should not be used after heating as the poisonous bees have collected it from various flowers that are having different tastes, qualities and potencies.Hence the persons dominated by pitta constitution mixed with hot substances in summer season and the area where the temperature is so high should not use the honey as it (is not good for health) kills them quickly, similar to that of poison. y A 115411 But the honey can be used after heating in the therapeutic procedures like emesis and medicated enemata with decoctions as it comes out of the body quickly without undergoing digestion.

Generally to treat indigestion hot substances and hot water are to be given. But this general line of treatment is contrary to treat the indigestion, caused by excessive consumption of honey. Because hot water and hot substances should not be given with honey and the cold substances are unwholesome in indigestion.Honey being a combination of different tastes, qualities and potencies, is the best yogavahi.

In suka varga different varieties of corns with bristles and their properties have been discussed. Among them rakta saliis superior and yavaka is inferior in their qualities. Different types of pulses like green gram, black gram, red gram, horse gram and theirproperties were discussed in simbi varga. Vagbhata stated that green gram is the best for preparation of dala and red gram for external application, black gram is not good among the pulses. Different types of food preparations like manda, peya, vilepi, yusa, mamsa rasa etc. and their properties and indications were mentioned in krtanna varga. In mamsa varga 8 groups of animals like mrga, viskira, pratuda, vilesaya, prasaha, mahamrgajalacara and matsya and alsotheir properties were discussed. In saka varga different types of leafy vegetables and other vegetables used in daily life have been discussed. In phala varga, draksa (grapes), dadima (pomegranate), plantain, dates, wood apple etc. have been discussed. Among them grapes are the best and likuca is the worst. In the end Vagbhata described some of the drugs useful as medicine in a separate group known as ousadha varga. Hence one must know the properties ofvarious substances individually and the combination of other substances to get the desired effects.ANNARAKSA ADHYAYA Protection of Food SubstancesnWPTFT: I ffrT ?

Usually wealthy persons, landlords and kings will have more enemies rather than friends. So, there is every possibility of poisoning the food and other substances by the close associates of the lords and others, to kill them and snatch the wealth.

Wl il K I I After 'Annaraksa vidhi Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'MatrasitIya' (Partaking Proper Quantity of Food), thus aid Lord Atreya and other great sages. MatrasitIya consists two words viz. matra asita. Matra means the quantity and asita represents the meaning for all the four types of food substances i.e. khadya, lehya, peya andprasya. Hence matrasita means the quantity of food is to be taken.Quantity of food has been classified into two types namely pinda rupa and pratidravyapeksita. As the quantity of food plays prominent role in the maintenance of positive health as well as the production of several diseases, it has been allocated a separate chapter by name MatrasitIya. Matra depends upon agni drarya swabhava:UMiyf) MejchM WWNI (U ): !J (frfcbl I ttMi U4 fi dt yfil m jjfcuimtWif rtj cH n i mrd ktdi i nuiymui Pif a HMfllM)4fri 11211One should always consume proper quantity of food only why because consumption of appropriate quantity of food increases the power of digestion. Such quantity of food depends upon the nature of food substances, such as light and heavy. If the digestive power is more, high quantity of the food also can be digested and when the power of digestion decreases one cannot take more quantity of food. Similarly light articles ofthe food and are by nature even if taken in excess they are less harmful. On the other hand heavy foods are more harmful. Hence heavy food substances should be taken half of the capacity of the individual and the light food substances also should not be taken to his full satiation. In fact appropriate quantity of the food is that which is digested easily without causing any trouble to the body. Notes:trouble to the body. Notes: In Astanga Sahgraha Sutra Sthana 11th chapter, features of proper quantity of food is more clearly delineated as under:Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 9 155 Aharamatra laksana (Features of proper quantity of food): TJffrT: f PT W S W T f f f l W f rT RWRTT wmK i (A.s.su. ii 5)Doesn't cause any discomfort in the abdomen.

Dandalasaka:Due to the obstruction of the channels, the vitiated dosas are unable to move in the upward or downward direction and begin to move in the side ward direction and makes the body stiff like a stick and can be called dandalasaka, which is incurable and should be discarded for giving treatment. Ama visa: Matrasitiva Adhyaya : 8 157Matrasitiva Adhyaya : 8 157 Due to the ingestion of unwholesome food, excessive food and also the food taken, before the previous meals get digested, ama converts into amavisa. Whenever ama transformed into Jma visa it will get all the 10 qualities of the poison (visa). Hence it is difficult to manage amavisa due to the contradictory line of treatment for ama and visa such as usna and sita cikitsa respectively. Treatment for alasaka:Vamana (emesis) with: Ugra Vaca (Acorus calamus) Saindhava lavana (rocksalt) Phala Madanaphala (Randia dumatorum) Warm water. Swedana (sudation therapy).

Eg: Parthiva dravya means that the drug which is predominantly consisting of prthivl Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 9 167mahabhuta along with the other four. Madhura rara dravya means the drug which is predominantly sweet in taste along with the other five. Similarly vata jwara means the fever caused due to the vitiation of vata predominantly and associated with the other two dosas. Rasa and anurasa (Primary and secondary tastes): In a substance rasa (primary main taste) is clearly perceptible where as the anurasa (secondarylaste) is not perceptible due to the dominance of primary taste or slightly perceptible at the end. Rasa has been described by having the qualities of the guru, laghu, sita, usna etc. But strictly speaking these are the qualities of the basic elements, which are present in the substance. It is only a categorical attribution and should not be taken as actual position. It is the quality of the substance but not of rasas. Parthiva dravya guna:115II The drugs that are having the qualities of guru (heavy), sthula (bulky), sthira (immobile) and also having the predominance of gandhaguna (smell) can be called as parthiva dravyas. Those drugs are responsible for the weight, firmness, steadiness and also the development of the body. Prthivi Jaliya (apya) dravya guna: 3TTXZT W HfdWJ cM y Kd y dl The drugs that are having the qualities of drava (liquid), sita (cold),guru (heavy), snigdha (unctuous), manda (dull), sandra (thick) and having the predominance of rasa guna (taste) can be called as jaliya dravyas. These drugs will produce unct uousness, secretions, moistness, Jala contentment and bindingness (holding together) in the body. Agneya dravya guna:Agneya dravya guna: The substances that are having the qualities of ruksa (dry), tiksna (sharp), usna (hot), visada (non slimy), suksma (minute) and also having the predominance of rupa guna (vision) are known as agneya dravyas. Agni These are responsible for burning, brightness, complexion and color, digestion etc. 168 Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana Vayaviya dravya guna:Vayaviya dravya guna: The drugs that are having the qualities of ruksa (dry), visada (non slimy), laghu (light), and also having the predominance of sparsaguna (touch) are known as vayavya dravyas. These drugs are responsible for dryness, lightness, non sliminess, weakness and division in the body. Vayu Akasiya dravya guna: fWciiydcMH The drugs that are having the qualities of suksma (minute), visada(non slimy), laghu (light) and also having the dominance of sabda guna (sound) are known as akasa dravyas. They are responsible for hollowness and lightness in the body. Akasa AH the substances are medicines: 111 0 II Nothing exists in the world that is non medicinal. That means all the substances available in the universe are useful for treatment in either way. Dominance of mahabhuta and the drug action:The drugs abounding with the qualities of agni and vayu have a tendency of upward movement. This is because of the lightness and upward mobile nature of vayu and upward flames of agni. The drugs abounding with the qualities of prthivi and ap on the other hand have a tendency of downward movement because of the heaviness of prthivi and downward flow ofjala.I Thus ends the description of dravya. Detailed classification of rasas will be discussed in the forthcoming chapter Rasa bhediya Adhyaya. Virya (Potency) Astavidha virya: 111 211 H ' k HJlrfljjJJT STd ci i MHUT I Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 9 169 According to some medical authorities virya has been classified into 8 types: 1. Guru (Heavy) 5. Laghu (Light) 2. Snigdha (Unctuous) 6. Ruksa (Dry) 3. Hima Sita(Cold) 7. Usna(Hot) 4. Mrdu (soft) 8. Tiksna (Sharp)Opinion of Caraka on virya: T eb dlS cHAF IS 111 3 II Hl4)4 cji rl fchf lrHcif 4)4 dl fe l I Virya is nothing but the potency of the drugs. Maharsi Caraka opines that all these actions of the drugs like elimination, mitigation etc are influenced by the potency of the drugs and without having potency no drug will show its action. Doctrine of eight fold poteney: eOilftsMI rHl"C Sflrl c)u4cl 111 4II VI try bffi)c frfM I oi)e(gU A rdl d ilil UIKftl 111 5 IIReasons for giving the designation of virya to guru and other gunas: As guru and the other seven qualities (total eight) have been mentioned predominantly. As they have been attributed in many a number of drugs. As they were mentioned in Ayurveda prior to rasa and others. As they are potent in comparison with rasas and the rest of gunas.3TW9' e M'0aroirH Hcirt4lM AdTTT if VIrl 4)4 ld: 111 6 II Rasa and other 12 qualities cannot consider as virya because they are having the opposite reasons mentioned in the above text. In this way eight types of potencies have been described by some acaryas. Out of the twenty, the eight qualities mentioned here are only those, which are capable of over coming the effects of rasa, and the other twelve are not contradicting the effects of rasa.Hence the above eight types of qualities of the drugs only can be identified as the potency of the drugs. For e.g. the effect of the pungent taste in pippall could normally be the aggravation of pitta, but by virtue of mrdu guna and sita virya, pippali alleviates rather than aggravates pitta. The effect of bitter and astringent tastes in pancamula usually should aggravate vata, but due to the hot in potency they are alleviating vata.

(1) usna virya and (2) sita virya. The qualities such as guru, laghu etc. and the seasons like debilitating and nourishing periods are having the predominance of only two elements agni (hot) and soma (cold). So, virya is also of 2 kinds hot and cold, even though the substances are having many qualities in them, heat and cold are more powerful than all others and the rest are within the scope of these two only.Usually the drugs containing katu, amla and lavana rasas are predominantly having usna virya in their succeeding order. Similarly tikta, kasaya, madhura rasa dravyas are predominantly having sita virya in their succeeding order.The potency of the drugs and diets can be ascertained while they are in association with the body and are immediately after they come in contact with the body. For example hot potency of meat of marshy animals is ascertained while it is under the process of digestion, where as the sharpness of marica can be determined immediately after its contact with the tongue.Effects of usna and sita virya dravya: rlsfifcuj 111 811 YT f"3"dld ,Lh4i): cMlfrl, f l K I Kd fleH t rtjfil H l : 111 911 Usna virya drugs are responsible for dizziness, thirst, fatigue, sweating, burning, rapid digestion and mitigation of vata and kapha in the body. Where as sita virya dravyas cause happiness, supporting life, obstruction withhold and purification of rakta and pitta. Vipaka (Taste after Digestion)Vipaka (Taste after Digestion) l eAmiftHI Hll dU I UtiHi MRuimi f Mlch f rl f4d: 1120 II After the intake of drugs or diet having different tastes gets digested by the digestive enzymes and undergo transformation in the form of another taste is known as vipaka. It is of three types: 1. Madhura vipaka 2. Amla vipaka 3. Katu vipaka Vipakaja rasabheda:T SrTTy WkHbM W: I frlThlfc U cbt A IUli cJkT: 112 1 II Generally, the substances having madhura and lavana rasa (sweet and saline in taste) will be transformed into madhura vipaka after getting digested. Amla rasa dravyas (sour substances) will be transformed into amla vipaka while the drugs having katu, tikta and kasaya rasa (pungent, bitter and astringent taste substances) will be transformed into katu vipaka. ww jTcZT TT J i Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 9 171Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 9 171 Generally the effects of rasa and vipaka are similar to one another. That means the substances having madhura, amla and katu vipaka will act according to the taste of those substances in most of the cases. Drug action depends on either rasa, guna, virya, vipaka or prabhava: ' U M l " J u c f i t f u i I d f c h M ISome drugs will act by their tastes, some others by their qualities, some by their potency some other by vipaka and still others by their special effect known as prabhava. Powerful one only comes into action among rasa etc: Utl lHi sMdT H C) 112 3 I! UMilrl I II24IIUtl lHi sMdT H C) 112 3 I! UMilrl I II24II Among the different factors such as taste, quality, potency etc. whichever is more powerful that makes the actions of others insignificant. In case of co existence of opposing factors the weaker one is overlooked by the stronger and comes into force. Natural order of strength of rasa and others:112 5II When rasa, vipaka, virya and prabhavas are in equal strength, vipaka defeats rasa, vipaka and rasa together defeated by virya, prabhava defeats all of them. This is the natural order of strength. Eg. honey consists of madhura rasa and katu vipaka. Though madhura rasa is capable to mitigate vata due to the dominance of katu vipaka it is increasing vata. Here the rasa is dominated by vipaka.Even though the meat of buffalo is having madhura rasa and madhura vipaka they will be dominated by usna virya and aggravates pitta. Similarly sura, a type of wine containing amla rasa, amla vipaka and usna virya, they were dominated by prabhava and acts as a galactogogue. Prabhava (Specific Action) tfnRHiiu Ai cbiJ IcifiJia ddjn iicivHMj 112 611 Try clrW eh I, cOl HHJWhere there is similarity in two drugs in relation to their rasa, vipaka and virya but in spite of this similarity these two drugs differ in their action. The distinctive feature responsible for their distinctive effects not supported by their rasa, vipaka and virya is considered as prabhava or specific action. Eg. both citraka (Plumbago zeylanica) and danti (Balliospermum montanum) are katu rasa,katu vipaka and usna virya. But, in spite of this similarity danti acts as a purgative while citraka172 Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana creates constipation. Similarly draksa and yastimadhu are having similar properties; draksa acts as a laxative while yasticauses constipation. Though ghee and milk are having madhura rasa, sita virya and madhura vipaka, ghee increases the power of digestion whereas milk doesn't. Vicitra pratyayarabdha dravya:JNJ I HrWh'Tir: Vfld cfci:f Tftq' J T: I Till now the general mode of action of the drugs has been described. In addition there is a special category of substances known as vicitra pratyayarabdha dravya. Eg. even though both wheat and barley are having madhura rasa and guru guna, wheat mitigates vata where as barley aggravates vata. Though milk and fish are having madhura rasa and guru guna, their virya is differed with one another as sita and usna respectively.another as sita and usna respectively. Similarly meat of lion and boar are also having madhura rasa and guru guna. Boar's meat will be transformed into madhura vipaka at the end of the digestion, as it is samana pratyayarabdha dravya. Whereas lion's meat is transformed into katu vipaka as it is vicitra pratyayarabdha dravya.ffrT JMld H cji iR dNHyi dHi WT F T WTtSSZM: 119 11 Thus ends the ninth chapter entitled Dravyadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya of Sutra Sthana in Astanga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.In the chapter Dravyadi Vijnaniya, Acarya Vagbhata explained the basic concepts of Dravyaguna such as rasa, guna, virya, vipaka, prabhava etc. Definition of rasa, actions, qualities of 5 kinds of substances parthiva, jaliya etc. Definition of virya, different types of vipaka and prabhava.

Sweet, sour, salt, bitter, pungent and astringent is the six fold combination of the taste and are giving better nourishment to the body in their preceding order.Rasa utpatti (Formation of tastes): '""Tdlhi Rasa or taste of the drugs and diet can be ascertained immediately f c j j j M P A after their contact with the tongue. f a B L .Rasa is the object of gustatory sense organ.

RasaThe taste does not manifest itself while the water is in the atmosphere. As soon as it starts falling on the ground it comes in contact with the atoms of five basic elements impelled by the atmosphere itself and there comes the first stage of the manifestation of the rasa. The culminating point of this manifestation is however reached when the water falls on the ground and it comes in contact with the individuals of plant and animal kingdom. At this stage the sixtastes manifests themselves in the individuals. Different seasons also play an important role, in the manifestation of tastes by the combination of the basic elements in different proportions.

Then the features of different tastes, actions and the complications due to excessive use of such substances and some of the substances pertaining to the group of all the six tastes have been presented. At the end 63 combinations of the tastes have been enumerated. Such combination and types are enunciated because they are useful in connection withmaintenance of health and cure of diseases.11 DOSADI VIJNANIYA ADHYAYA Knowledge of Dosa, Dhatu and Mala 3T TRTt r r f W r W M WTTRFT: I ffrT ? w p t w i t I I After ' Rasabhediya Adhyaya' Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Dosadi Vijnaniya '(Knowledge of Dosa, Dhatu and Mala), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. The word 'dosadi' represents the tridosas, sapta dhatus and trimalas. Chief constituents of the body:Body is nothing but the combination of dosa, dhatu and malas. If these body constituents are in the equilibrium, body will be in the healthy state. Dosas when aggravated manifest their signs and symptoms in accordance with the degree of aggravation, those in the state of diminution gave up their normal signs and symptoms and those in a state of equilibrium operate properly. Hence it is very much essential to know thefeatures of dosa, dhatu and malas of normal, abnormal and below normal levels, so that the drug and diet of different types, which have been already studied in the previous chapters, can be utilized to maintain the equilibrium. Specially to get the knowledge of normal and abnormal features of dosa, dhatu and malas, this chapter has been explained.Prakrta Dosa Karma (Normal Functions of Dosas) rt FT: I dcHlgl wPigi ai lJIcltW: "1 " m f d H l l r M l c f d r i l T i M c k l : II2 IIFunctions of normal vata: Maintenance the body with enthusiasm, expiration, inspiration, movement of various parts, maintenance of dhatus, expulsion of natural urges and keenness of sense perceptions are the normal functions of vata.

Similarly the opposite qualities of dosas etc. increases in the body, that means the concerned dosas are decreased. For eg. the opposite qualities of vata like unctuousness, heaviness and hotness decreases in the body means vata is increased.Unctuousness, heaviness and hotness increased in the body infers that vata is decreased. Accumulation of waste products in the body indicates the increase of malas and the excessive elimination suggests the decrease of malas. UHlf drdl HI S r a t o j i J U H : 112 5 11Accumulation of malas in the body is natural. Their decrease causes harm to the body. Hence decreased quantity of malas is more harmful than the accumulation. Asraya asrayi bhava (Relationship of dhatus and dosas): dsll yP)dl firrrgfetrJtTfcit l : I rlut rl qIM19TOT9If4 Jli firST: 1126 II Dosadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 11 193 I c d U , cflrchM farl: II29III c d U , cflrchM farl: II29II There is a definite relationship between dosas and dhatus because all the substances in the jniverse are formed by the five basic elements only. Asrayi Asraya Vata Asthi dhatu Pitta Rakta and sveda Kapha Rasa, mamsa, meda, majja, sukra and mala mutra. Vata resides in asthi dhatu, pitta in rakta and sweda where as kapha resides in the rest of dhatus. viz. rasa, mamsa, medas, majja, sukra, mala and mutra.The causative factors which are responsible for the increase and decrease of the asrayis (dosas) also causes to increase and decrease of asrayas (dhatu and malas) respectively except in the case of vata. That means: The factors responsible for the increase of pitta, also increases rakta and sweda, and vice versa. Similarly, the factors which increases kapha also increases rasa, mafhsa, meda, majja,sukra, mala, mutra and vice versa. But the factors which increases vata, doesn't increase asthi dhatu, moreover it decreases. Similarly those factors increasing asthi causes diminishing of vata. Generally the increases of all dhatus are due to over nutrition and predominance of kapha. Nourishing therapy increases kapha and all other dhatus but reduces vata. Reducing therapy decreases all the dhatus and increases vata.Hence the diseases caused by increase or decrease of dhatus is to be treated with reducingor nourishing therapies respectively except in vata. In all the cases the use of substances, qualities and actions either opposite or similar but not antagonistic to the dhatus is to be planned appropriately. Notes: Causes for increase decrease of the tissues and the treatment:The body tissues generally increases by the use of foods and activities which are similar or possessing similar properties, they undergo decrease by the use of food and activities which are opposite or possessing opposite properties.The dhatus which are heavy, undergo increase by the use of the substances having similar properties of heaviness, similarly the dhatus which are light, undergo increase by the use of light substances. By the use of opposite substances they undergo decrease. The substances, which are materially similar causes the increase rapidly. 194 Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana194 Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana Rakta dhatu increases rapidly by the use of the blood. Mamsa dhatu increases rapidly by the use of ingestion of meat. Medo dhatu increases rapidly by the use of muscle fat. Asthi dhatu increases rapidly by the use of bones. Majja dhatu increases rapidly by the use of bone marrow. Sukra dhatu increases rapidly by the use of semen or eggs.The substances possessing similar qualities may not present near by or not available (or) though available may not be suitable to the individuals (or) being unwholesome (or) causing aversion (or) tastelessness (or) due to any other reason it is the best to make use of the substances possessing similar properties.Eg. in the condition of sukra dhatu ksaya , the use of milk, ghee and other substances possessing sweet in taste, unctuousness and cold in potency are indicated.

Reason for the increase or decrease of body tissues: fel M HI mffsfarTT: I Mi MlcUfrljlfa'STf U l M l : II34IIDhatwagni is nothing but the part or share of jatharagni (digestive power), which is present in side of all the sapta dhatus. This is also another factor responsible for the increase or decrease of bodily tissues due to the debility and intensity of the dhatwagni respecti vel y. Though the forest fire (davagni) is continuously burning, gets flared up greatly at certain times and decreased at other times, depending upon the nature of the fuel available. So also thetransformation of tissues undergoes increase or decrease depending upon nature of food substances. Substances, which are similar or dissimilar to the dhatus, are the causes for their increase or decrease respectively because each one has its own specific action in quickly transforming them.

Importance of ojas: 196 Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana196 Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana Ojas is the chief fluid material of the body. Life depends on ojas only. Loss of ojas leads to death.

Treatment: Milk with jlvaniyagana dravyas. Mutton juice (soup).

Reason for paying the interest and haterdness of substances:Nl fanfldyUHAll: l g t : 1143 IIIf the dosas are in the increased state, the person wishes to take the substances, which are having exactly opposite in nature of such dosas. Similarly if they are in decreased state, the person wishes to take the food having the similar qualities to that of the diminished dosas. By knowing the above fact it is easy to know the vitiation i.e. either increase or decrease of the dosas, but the unintelligent persons are unable to recognize status of dosas.Action of dosas according to their state:rSJT f ETSnW T l MI fad drl 1144II Dosadi Vijnaniya Adhyaya : 11 197 Whenever the dosas increase they amplify their respective features depending upon their strength.

But whenever they are in the imbalanced state i.e. either increased or decreased state causes the destruction of the body.

The basic principles of the treatment is to bring back the normal state of the dosas either increased or decreased by applying samanya visesa siddhanta. Hence it is very much essential to know the normal functions and the features of the increased or decreasedstate of dosa, dhatu and malas. After that dosa, dhatu and malas relationship (asrayasrayi bhava) was discussed. At the end definition of ojas, features, importance, causes for diminution and their signs symptoms, and also the treatment was explained.DOSABHEDIYA A D H Y A Y A Classification of Dosas H U H3T2TfiTr N hTMR c i i H : I ffcT f w f a : II After 'Dosadi Vijnaniya' Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'DosabhedIya' (Classification of Dosas ) thus said Atreya and other great sages.

The present chapter dealt with the different types of dosas, their places and the normal functions, factors responsible for their accumulation, aggravation and alleviation, types ofdiseases caused by different dosas various combinations of increased and decreased dosas etc. Relationship between dosas and pancamahabhutas: Vata is formed by the combination of vayu and akasa.

In such condition, the vitiated dosas manifest their abnormal symptoms and results in the occurrence of diseases.Prasama (Normalcy): f d M W UMdl f4chKW 7cT:7nT: I Equilibrium state of dosas in their original places is known as prasama. Notes: Just as the clouds are brought together at one place by the wind and made to rain, the aggravated dosas produce diseases either in the whole part of the body, half of it, in any one organ being brought there by the influence of vata.The vitiated dosas causes troubles to the body by producing various types of diseases. Among them, 80 are produced by vata, 40 are due to pitta and 20 by the vitiation of kapha.

As the vata also having the similar qualities, vata undergoes caya (mild increase) only, but not prakopa (further aggravation) merely because of the hotness of the season. The vata (samirana), which, accumulates in grisma rtu, will be aggravated in varsa rtu due to its coldness and subsides automatically in sarad rtu. In varsa rtu, pitta undergoes only caya, because of the food substances that are used possessamla vipika, but not prakopa mearly because of the coldness of the season. The pitta, which accumulates in varsa rtu, will be aggravated in sarad rtu and subsides automatically in hemanta rtu. In sisira rtu, kapha undergoes only caya by the use of food substances, which are unctuous, cold etc. that are similar to the dosa. Kapha becomes solidified by the effect of season and doesn't undergo prakopa. Kapha become liquified in vasanta rtu and gets aggravated, and subsidesautomatically in grisma rtu.JAJI illPd H f liRl tjlHI: chlrtifa T'R'g I The above changes of the dosas will be taken place naturally by the influence of the seasons.

(b) Anugami (Manifested after the primary disease). Purogami: It is also known as purvarupai.e. premonitory symptoms. Anugami: It is called upadrava or complications.

Acarya Vagbhata expressed that these dosas gets vitiated not only due to the irregular diet, iietics etc. but also due to the variations of the seasons also. Hence the relationship between the dosas and seasons has been mentioned. Next, definition of ama, features of sama and niramadosas and also the line of treatment for ama dosas are explained.

Brmhana: Whatever adds to the corpulence of the body is brmhanaox nourishing therapy. Langhana: Whatever is capable to reduce the body is known as langhana or reducing therapy. Dominancy of mahabhuta:Generally the body gets nourished by the use of substances having the dominancy of prthivl and ap mahabhutas, while it is reducing due to the substances having the agni, vayu and akasa mahabhutas. eH n i t 1 !

Brmhana (nourishing therapy), 2. langhana (reduction therapy), 3. snehana (oleation :herapy), 4. svedana (sudation therapy), 5. stambhana (astringent therapy) and 6. ruksana (drying therapy). Snehana and stambhana can be included in brmhana therapy while svedana and ruksana comes under langhana therapy, basing on the bhuta predominance and their similar actions.

Niruha (medicated enemata with decoctions), 2. vamana (emesis), 3. kaya vireka (purgation), 4. siro vireka (nasal administration) and 5. asravisruti (blood letting).

If all the drugs mentioned in any one of the groups are not available due to the season and ecological conditions, one can opt alternative drugs having similar therapeutic properties.Prescribing the above drugs in the form of kalka (paste), quatha (decoction), sneha (medicated oil), lehya, pana (internal use), nasya (nasal administration), vasti (medicated enemata) after assessing dosa, dusya etc. will be useful even in the management of krcchra sadhya roga (diseases cured with great difficulty).FFSTFT T M i l S S Z M : 111 5 11 Thus ends the fifteenth chapter entitled Sodhanadigana Sangraha Adhyaya of Sutra Sthana in Astanga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.In the present chapter initially the classification of the drugs according to the mode of their action such as sodhana and samana was enumerated. Then it was classified according to the action of several drugs which acts on a group of disease conditions and the nomenclature of the Sodhanadigana Sangraha Adhyaya : 15 253group was given by the drug mentioned at first such as vidaryadi gana, saribadi gana, padmakadigana, guducyadigana etc. For eg: guducyadi gana means the group is headed by guduci. By hearing the word guducyadi gana, one must be in a poition to recollect the group of drugs such as guduci, padmaka, arista, dhanyaka and rakta candana along with their actions viz pitta kapha hara, jwarahara, chardi, trsna dahaharaas well as increasing the power of digestion.Hence it is much more beneficial for the practitioner while treating a patient. In this way 33 groups of drugs have been enumerated by Vagbhata in this chapter.SNEHA VIDHI A D H Y A Y A Oleation TherapyAfter ' Sodhanadigana Sangraha AdhyayaAcarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter lSneha vidhi' (Oleation Therapy), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. The main intention of Ayurveda is to maintain the positive health in the healthy individuals as well as to treat the diseased persons. To treat the diseased persons 3 kinds of therapeutic procedures have been mentioned such as daivavyapasraya, yuktivyapasraya and sattvavajaya(spiritual therapy, rational therapy and psychotherapy). Further rational therapy is subdivided into 3 types viz. antahparimarjana, bahih parimarjana and sastra pranidhana (internal purification, external cleansing and surgical therapy). Both the internal purification and external cleansing can be incorporated into sadupakramas. For the sake of convenience in the treatment all the six therapeutic procedures can be grouped into two only such as brmhana andlahghana (nourishing therapy and reducing therapy), which were already discussed in the previous chapter. Reducing therapy is again of 2 types:(a) Sodhana (elimination therapy) and (b) Samana (palliative therapy). Sodhana therapy: Sodhana therapy means purificatory measures. Maharsi Caraka has been classified them as under: 1. Vamana karma (emesis) 2. Virecana karma (purgation) 3. Asthapana vasti (medicated enemata with decoctions) 4. Anuvasana vasti (enemata with oils) 5. Nasya karma (nasal administration)Where as in Susruta Samhita, rakta moksana is added to the above by clubbing both types of vasti treatments as one, so that the number five remains the same. Before proceeding to the purificatory measures, pre operative procedures like oleation and sudation should be conducted to bring back the vitiated dosas from sakhas (periphery) to kostha (central part of the body). Without conducting these preoperative techniques, the vitiated dosas cannot reach the central part of the body.Hence it is very much essential to conduct the pre operative procedures prior to perform Pahcakarma treatments.Sneha Vidhi Adhyaya : 16 255 Before starting the therapy, physician should procure the drugs in required quantity, which will be useful for oleation therapy and also the antidotes, to manage the complications. Qualities of oleating drugs:yi l, IcwAd fc l umjn II Generally, drugs which are guru (heavy), sita (cold), sara (mobile), snigdha (unctuous), manda (slow), suksma (subtle), mrdu (soft) and drava (liquid) are useful for oleation therapy and the drugs having exactly opposite qualities like laghu (light), usna (hot), sthira (stable), ruksa (dry), tiksna (sharp), sthula (bulky), kathina (hard) and sandra (solid) are useful for dryness of the body.the body. Literally sneha means oleate or to make smooth. The process of producing unctuousness, fluidity, softness and smoothness in the body is known as oleation.

Out of all unctuous substances, ghee is the best one, because it follows the properties of the substances with which it is processed, as it is sweet in taste, not producing any burning sensation and is taken since birth.Sarpih, majja, vasa and taila are superior to one another in mitigating pitta in the preceding order, and in their succeeding order they mitigate vata and kapha. dlrld ciyi rldl M I ddlsft T I Ghrta, taila, vasa and majja are heavier to one another in their succeeding order that means bone marrow is the heaviest among the four unctuous substances. The combination of any of the two unctuous substances can be known as yamaka.

Internal administration of oleating substances without adding any other substance is known as acchapeya.Sneha vicaranas are of 64 types in accordance with that number of combinations of rasas. Accha peya gives proper oleating signs and symptoms faster than vicaraniya . Hence the former is superior to the later. Dosage of oleating substances: 711 t j A i H j n 8ii711 t j A i H j n 8ii The quantity of oil digested in two yamas (six hours) is called hrasva matra. Madhayama matra will be digested in four yamas (twelve hours) and the quantity, which, will be digested in eight yamas (24 hours), is called uttama matra. Keeping the intensity of dosas, seasons, wholesomeness etc in mind, start the oleation therapy, with the minimum dose or less than that is called hrasiyasi matra or test dose.Oil should not be administered internally without knowing the kostha. If so, at times the life of the patient may be put into danger. Notes: Hrasva matra: It is indicated for the persons who are weak, having decreased digestive power, children, aged, delicate persons, habituated to take unwholesome food, remains empty, suffering with fever, diarrhoea, cough etc.It is ideal because it is easy to administer, as the quantity is less. It gives strength slowly. And is not creating any complications. Sneha Vidhi Adhyaya : 16 259 Madhayma matra: It is indicated for diabetes, urustambha, carbnucles, skin diseases gout etc. and the personshaving mrdu kostha. It will produce unctuousness in the body, without reducing the strength of the body. Though complications may arise, they are mild. It also helps to eliminate the vitiated dosas from the body. Uttama matra: It is indicated for hectic personalities, having increased digestive power, strength, able to withstand hunger, thirst and physical strain, tumors, reverse peristalasis, herpes, snake bite, insanity, dysurea etc.It cures the diseases caused by all the three pathways of the diseases. Classification of Sneha Dravyas According to Their Mode of Action Oleating substances are also can be classified into 3 types as under: 1. Sodhana sneha, 2. Samana sneha, 3. Brmhana sneha. 1. Sodhana sneha:Oleating substances used for the sake of elimination, maximum dose is to be given early in the morning without mixing with any other substances and after the completion of the digestion of the food taken in the previous night. Here the drug is administering in maximum dose and for a shorter duration i.e. maximum 7 days. 2. Samana sneha:f t s f r mzmnr j in 9 n Administration of the oleating substances internally in the medium dose, in the empty stomach when the person gets hungry, is known as samana sneha. Here the dosage of the unctuous substances are less than sodhana sneha and should be administered till the symptoms of the diseases disappeared. 3. Brmhana sneha:Administration of unctuous substances in a minimum dosage, which is mixed with mutton soup, wine and along with the food for a longer period for the nourishment of the body is known as brmhana sneha.

Effects of snehapana:Oil administered before, during and after eating food will be useful to the patients in the management of the diseases occurring to the lower, middle and upper parts of the body respectively and also gives strength to the body parts in the similar order. Anupana for different unctuous substances: Generally hot water is to be given immediately after administering the unctuous substances, for the easy digestion and to remove the coating in the mouth.But hot water should not be given while administering the substances having hot in potency such as tuvaraka taila and aruskara taila.

Notes: Snehapana vidhi : Purva karma (Pre operative procedure):Before starting the oleation therapy, screen the patient whether the patient is eligible or not. Before administering the oleating substances, the patient is to be given mild doses of medicines (carminatives) to stimulate the digestive power and to make the G. I. tract light. Assess the kostha and have a plan regarding the duration of the therapy as 3 days, 5 daysand 7 days in mrdu, madhyama and krura kostha respectively. Kostha pariksa: Intake of jaggary, sugarcane juice, milk, whey, rice pudding, ghee, grape juice, hot water etc. serves as a purgative for those having mrdu kostha. The above cannot produce purgative effect i n krura kostha, where as in madhyama kostha mild laxative effect can be seen. 262 Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana262 Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana Pradhana karma (Main operative procedure): After the completion of the digestion of the food taken in the previous night, medicated oil should be given orally early in the morning, between 15 30 minutes after sunrise, by sitting comfortably in a chair.

Properties of sudation and astringent therapeutic drugs. Signs and symptoms of proper and excessive astringent therapy. Indications and contra indications for sudation therapy and at the end, advantages of sudation therapy has been presented.18V A M A N A V I R E C A N A V I D H I A D H Y A Y A Emesis Purgation Therapies 3TSTRTf SJTR r iWT: I ffrT ? Tl T: After 'Sweda vidhi Adhyaya' Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter ' Vamana Virecana vidhi ' (Emesis and Purgation Therapies), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. Definition of vamana and virecana and the mode of action of emetic and purgative drugs have Teen delineated by the author of Astanga Sahgraha in a lucid way as under. Vamana and virecana:H HI ts HitmTPt T H l Hlf l Hrtir l cl I E pulsion of vitiated dosas through mouth can be termed as emesis, and through rectum can be called as purgation. In both the conditions as the vitiated dosas are expelling from the body, the term 'virecana 'is suitable for both emesis and pur gation. Mode of action of the emetics and purgatives: Wepui WPJ r oilcllRMM fcJH fl H FfcrT n f t l f t r r fafe Pd I f uui tfe, MlRk M: F f c l r P f RAs the emetic drug contain usna, tlksna, suksma, vyavayiand vikaslgunas and also due to their potency they will reach the region of the heart through the minute channels. Due to oleation and udation the vitiated dosas become liquefied and enter into minute channels. There the emetic drug further liquefies the dosas due to usna guna and breaks into pieces because of tlksna and vikasi gunas. From there the liquefied dosas reach the kostha without sticking to the channelsas the water runs through the walls of the earthenware which has been anointed with oil. Then :he vitiated dosas will be expelled through mouth, because of the drugs having the dominancy of agni and vayu bhutas, involvement of udana vata and also the upward movement of the emetic drug. And the vitiated dosas will be expelled through rectum, because of the drugs having the dominancy of prthivl and ap mahabhutas, involvement of apana vata and also thedownward movement of the purgative drug. If :he drugs have both these qualities, they will be having emetic as well as purgati ve action.278 Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana Emesis and purgation according to dosas: fiilVl T chlhlcdUl I d r l i ffcl A Emesis is to be conducted when: Kapha is vitiated alone or in association of pitta. Pitta and vata occupies the place of kapha. Increase of tridosas, with the predominance of kapha. Purgation is to be conducted when: Pitta is vitiated alone or in association of kapha.

Purgation therapy should be conducted only to the persons who have undergone oleation and sudation, again after emesis.The day before purgation, the patient should be given mutton soup and the diet, which should not stir up kapha. It should be warm, liquid, and unctuous added with sour fruit juices such as pomegranate etc. On the day of purgation, after the completion of the process of digestion of the food taken in the previous day, purgative drug is to be administered early in the morning, after passing the period of predominance of kapha dosa, after determining the nature of kostha.Purgative drug should be administered in the empty stomach only. dgftlTi) IT)u fi fejRx Mrl I FMdMI bd: ttT: T W T m r f T f II34II Whenever pitta is predominant, the nature of kostha will be known as mrdu kostha (soft bowels) and even milk causes purgation.Similarly the nature of kostha will be assessed as krura kostha (hard or costive bowels) when there is dominancy of vata and causes purgation with great difficulty even after the administration of syama, snuhi, kahkustha and other drastic purgatives. Pradhana karma: Purgation without emesis causes the obstruction of the purgative drug by vitiated kaphaand the drug may act adversely and also loose its power of elimination. Due to the forceful action of the purgative drug, accumulated kapha reaches the left side of the abdomen, duodenum and causes distention of abdomen or dysentery. These complications will not occur in the persons having costive bowel, because of the predominance of vata.The complications observed in purgation without emesis are also found in case of conducting purgation during the period of kapha predominance. Pain, distension of the abdomen and heaviness are the symptoms observed. Hence purgative drug should be given only after passing the period of kapha dominancy. Suitable purgative drug according to dosa:cbNIAm : farl feAeh:, wfc f rrylbU Hdtf)cjfif Purgation is to be conducted with the drugs, which are having kasaya and madhura rasa for pitta diseases.

Then asked the patient to gargle his mouth with warm water and inhale the smell of soil, lemon, madiphala, jasmine etc. ' Afterwards the patient is asked to take rest in a room, which is devoid of heavy breeze, and drink warm water at regular intervals to initiate the urges.Should not suppress the urges and evacuate the bowels in the bed pan to measure the quantity of output.

Otherwise it may be harmful and cause even death. 290 Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana290 Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana The drug in smaller and repeated doses will be able to eliminate the vitiated dosas from the body gradually and brings back the normalcy of dosas without causing any weakness in the body.

Other wise they trouble the person greatly and even kill him.Procedure of elimination in case of mandagni and krura kostha: tfrtchlB n T f l K H c t t i : 115 2 11 Those who are having weak digestive power and costive bowels (krura kostha) should be given ghee processed with alkalies and salts prior to the administration of purificatory drugs to restore the power of digestion as well as to conquer kapha and vata.

In such circumstances conduct vasti karma initially followed by snigdha virecana with eranda taila or bindu ghrta.(or) Remove the obstructed faeces by means of phalavarti (rectal suppositories) and then administer snigdha virecana dravya. Administer purgative drug after mild oleation:Persons who are suffering from visa (poison), abhighata (injury), pitika (boils), kustha (skin disorders), sopha (swelling), visarpa (herpes), kamala (jaundice), pandu (anemia), meha (diabetes) etc. should be administered purgative drug after mild oleation.

Uttara basti.Notes: Asthapana basti: Asthapana vasti dravya is prepared from different kinds of substances such as animal, plant and mineral origin, according to the involvement of dosa and dusyas. The different types of asthapana bastis are: 1. Utkledana vasti (exciting), 2. sodhana vasti (purificatory), 3. samana vasti (mitigating), 4. lekhana vasti (scarifying), 5. brmhana vasti (nourishing), 6. vajikarana vasti (aphrodisiac),7. piccha vasti (which arrests the expulsion of liquids from the body), 8. madhu tailika vasti (honey and oil are the main ingredients), 9. yapana vasti (can be given for long periods), 10. yuktaratha vasti (can travel after vasti), 11. siddha vasti (can obtain the expected results),Ascotananjana Vidhi Adhyaya : 23 293 .. sahara (alleviate dosas) are the synonyms for madhu tailika vasti. eir nomenclature itself suggests the characteristic features of the above types of asthapana nsti.

It causes instant relief, nourishment to the body and also eliminates the vitiated vata dosas completely from the body. Vata is the leader among the dosika trio, independent, and is responsible for all the physiological functions of the body.As it is of five types, it occupies all parts of the body, controls creation, sustenance and destruction of all external and internal things and also causes for the production of diseases in all the three pathways. Though emesis and purgation eliminate the vitiated dosas from the body, the drugs used in those therapies are pungent, sharp and hot in potency, which cannot be taken easily by the children and old persons. But vasti can be given in all age groups without any hesitation.Hence it is also advisable for children, old persons, emaciated, obese, tissue depletion, weak sense organs, women, infertility or difficulty in labor due to the vitiation of vata. It is also advisable to improve digestive power, color complexion, intelligence, voice, life span and happiness.Vasti is useful to maintain the youth and also beneficial in diseases like lameness, urustambha, fractures, contractures, distension of abdomen, colic, anorexia, reverse peristalsis, cutting pain in the rectum etc. Ascotananjana Vidhi Adhyaya : 23 311 Hence vasti is described as half of the treatment for almost all diseases and some others opine that it is full treatment even. Importance of siravedhana:Importance of siravedhana: Similarly siravedhana also occupies unique position in the management of endogenous as well as exogenous diseases born by the vitiation of blood. Thus ends the nineteenth chapter entitled Vasti vidhi Adhyaya of Sutra Sthana in Astanga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta.In this chapter Vasti vidhi, Acarya Vagbhata explained the process of vasti in detail.

Su. 35): Srngavacarana:Application of horns of cow, buffalo etc. to aspirate vitiated blood from the body is known as srngavacarana. Horn is of 7 inches length, and the circumference is of a thumb size and black gram size at the base and tip respectively.Before starting the procedure, give a small incision at the place from where the blood is to be aspirated and allow the blood to flow for some time. Then apply horn on the part after wrapping a clean cloth at the base. After that, aspirate the blood from the tip of the horn with mouth. Alabu: Generally it is known as tumbi. Take the medium sized fruit, cut the stalk region and then remove the pulp and use the shellfor blood letting. Lit a lamp or a cotton piece and put it inside the fruit. Then give a small incision and apply this gourd by approximating the edges of the mouth so closely that no atmospheric air enters into it. The lamp will be off after exhausting the oxygen inside the fruit and vacuum will be formed, which will be helpful to suck the blood from the body. After 10 15 minutes remove the gourd and apply jatyadi ghrta and then bandage withsterile cloth. Ghati yantra: The method of application is similar to alabu. Pracchana: Salyaharana Vidhi Adhyaya : 28 377 m i y i y f c i : 115 2 II A long cloth piece or a rope or a leather strap is to be tied above the part of the body, where it is selected for venesection. Care should be taken while conducting venesection by avoiding the places such as tendons, joints and vital points.Incision should be given from downward to upword direction only. Incision should not be too deep, too wide and horizontal (sidewards). Different types of blood letting in different conditions: Pracchana is indicated to drain the accumulated blood from a particular point. Deep seated blood can be extracted with the help of leach application. To drain the vitiated blood, which has settled in different layers of the skin, srriga, alabuand ghati yantra will be useful. Venepuncture is advised whenever vitiated blood circulates in the body. Srriga, jalouka and alabu are especially indicated for vata, pitta and kapha disorders respectively.

In this chapter Acarya Vagbhata has been explained various types of surgical instruments in ietail. 26 sharp instruments and their functions, their description; accessory instruments like rhga, alabu, jaloukaetc. have been discussed.OIR A V YADH A VIDHI ADHYAYA Venesection H H H H H E l i i v i s iAfter 'Sastra vidhi Adhyaya', Acarya Vagbhata expounded the chapter 'Siravyadha vidhi' (Venesection), thus said Lord Atreya and other great sages. (In the previous chapter blood letting with accessory instruments have been discussed such as leach, horn, gourd and pot etc. In the present chapter blood letting with the help of sharp instruments along with pre operative and post operative care has been discussed.)SIRAVYADHA (VENESECTION) Importance of venesection: There are a number of techniques for blood letting, which were described earlier. Among them, and in the therapies like purgation, venesection occupies the most important place for the management of curable diseases. As the water comes out and the plants die on cutting the borders of the field, vitiated blood comes out and automatically the diseases will be cured on performing venesection.As far as Kayacikitsa is concerned vasti karma is an important therapeutic procedure, because almost all the curable diseases can be cured with the help of the same. Similarly siravedhana occupies a unique position in Salya tantra as it can manage a number of diseases. Blood is the seat for the diseases, which were caused by the vitiation of the blood and hence venesection is the first line of treatment suggested. Features of pure blood:qijtdctui II H I d STOcf: , rpil'kl'W rf rfrf: I Pure blood is sweet and slightly salt in taste, neither too cold nor hot and liquid. Its color resembles as follows: Padma (lotus flower), indragopa (bright red insect), hema (mahjistha) (rubiacordifolia), avi, sasa lohita lohitam (resembling the blood of sheep and hare). Such blood is known as pure blood and it keeps the body healthy. The blood formed due to the in take of wholesome food cause, strength, color, complexion,happiness and longe vity of the body. Siravyadha Vidhi Adhyaya: 27 379 Deceases causesd by vitiation of blood: d l r M r l f c : yi4) d d : 112 II 114II Due to the intake of opposite qualities of the substances and also the nature of autumn season radrtu), the blood gets vitiated by pitta and kapha and causes the following disorders.lsaipa (herpes), vidradhi (abscess), pliha (enlargement of spleen), gulma (tumor), nisadana (decreased power of digestion), jwara (fever), mukha, netra, siroroga (diseases of mouth, eyes and head), madatyaya (alcoholic toxicity), trsna (thirst), lavanasyata (salty taste ine mouth), kustha (skin disorders), vatarakta (gout), raktapitta (bleeding disorders), katu and mlodgara (pungent and sour eructation), bhrama (giddiness). If the curable diseases are not responded even after the administration of the suitable drugs having the properties like hot, cold, dry, unctuous etc; it can be inferred that the person is jffering from the disease born by the vitiation of blood.

Ksaras (Caustic alkalies its properties):Ksaras (caustic alkalies) are derived f rom the combination of different kinds of drugs of all the tastes but with the predominance of pungent and salt. Drugs possessed the properties such as penetrating and hot in potency and do the functions such as dahana (burning), pacana (digesting), avadharana (tearing), vilayana (dissolving), sodhana (cleaning) and ropana (healing) etc.Cures worm infestation, indigestion, obesity and the complications of poisons. Supremacy of caustic alkalies (ksaras): As the caustic alkalies perform the functions such as excision, incision, extraction and scarification, they are superior among all the sharp and accessory instruments.Caustic alkalies can be used in places where the sharp instruments failed and in conditions such as nasal polyps, malignant tumors etc. and also in the chronic ulcers due to the vitiation of all the tridosas. Caustic alkalies are also can be administered internally in case of difficult disease conditions. Therefore caustic alkalies are definitely superior among all the sharp and accessary instruments. Types of ksaras: Caustic alkalies are of two types such as:(a) Abhyantara parimarjana (internal administration) (b) Bahyaparimarjana (external application) Ksara Agnikarma Vidhi Adhyaya : 30 413 i a) Abhyantara parimarjana: Abhyantara parimarana is indicated in diseases such as piles, impaired digestion, urinary calculi, abdominal tumors, ascitis, artificial poisoning etc. ib) Bahya parimarjana: fr T:"OT l ql jNI iyhchB PdN 113Bahya parimarjana is indicated in diseases such as black moles, leucoderma, external piles, leprosy and other skin disorders, tumors, fistula, chronic ulcers, sinuses, warts etc. Contraindications for ksara prayoga: filrl T S t 114II W R m R MIU cllHilST ff I RlRA d 'VU I R TSft" yef'llstJl 115 II f t l N u r f l y l T l i h i l l P l 13T3fhrfs 116 II M U l A l d M l d t 117IIM U l A l d M l d t 117II Both types of ksara are contraindicated in the following conditions pitta roga, raktaja roga, Jta roga, weakness, fever, diarrhoea, diseases of the head and heart, anaemia, anorexia, .:taract, after sodhana, swelling all over the body, panic, pregnant, during menstruation, prolapsed uterus, indigestion, during childhood and old age.

He should worship it and pray to the Gods of tree. The next day he doesn ' t witness any unnatural omen, should go to the tree early in the morning immediately after sunrise, and cut the branches of the tree, which spreads to the east or north.Similarly the branches of paribhadra, palasa, asvakarna, rajavrsksa, mahavrksa, vrksaka, mdravrksa, vrsa, saptacchada, naktamala, tilvaka, kadali, vibhitaki, citraka, apamarga, agnimantha, four types of kosataki etc. should be collected along with the roots, fruits, leaves and branches and cut into pieces and made into heap. Another heap of crystals of limestone should also be made near the heaps of the logs of muskaka, all these set on fire and the ashes are collected.Then take the above ash and add 4 times water and 4 times cow's urine and stirred well and then filter it with a thick cloth till a clear, red, thick liquid is obtained.The precipitate is kept on an oven and cooked nicely similar to that of snehapaka. During the process add the macerated powder of limestones, paste of the excreta of cock, peacock, falcon, heron, pegion; bile juice of animals and birds, haritala, manahsila saindhava lavana etc., conch shell and made red hot in an iron pan and then made it cool.

This should be used after 7 days, depending upon the strength of the disease. Indications of different types of ksara:Tiksna ksara is indicated in arbuda and other disorders caused by the vitiation of vata, kapha and medas. Madhyama ksara should be used in arbuda and other diseases when they are having moderate strength. Where as mrdu ksara is indicated in arsas arise due to the dominancy of pitta and rakta.

Srsti utpatti krama mentioned in Ayurveda is based on Sahkhya and Vaisesika philosophies. The word 'tattwal is used to denote the causative factors of the creation. According to Sahkhya darsana, the universe is created by twentyfive (25) tattwas and mentioned that prakrti and purusa are the basic causative factors for the creation. Susruta also expressed the similar opinion.opinion. Neither prakrti nor purusa is able to do creation independently. When prakrti comes in contact with purusa, prakrti gets stimulated and united together and loses its balance, which leads to a variety of changes. These changes result in creation and the evolutionary process is as follows.Srsti utpatti krama Prakrti Purusa ' I Mahat I Ahankara Sattvika Rajasika Tamasika J Panca Panca Manas Panca jnanendriyas karmendriyas tanmia trasPanca mahabhuta According to the Sahkhya philosophy everything in the universe looked upon as the result of the transformation within one primordial substance known as prakrti. The subject of the knowledge is called purusa and the object of knowledge is prakrti. As prakrti is the primordial ;ause of the universe of everything excepting only soul, which is uncaused, and accounts for w hatever is physical, both matter and force, it is called pradhana. All creation is the result of arelationship established between these two. Still there is a unity which underlies this duality.510 Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana Synonyms of prakrti: 1. Pradhana: As it is the primordial substance for the creation. l.Avidya: Which is devoid of knowledge. 3. Maya: Which causes for a variety of creation. 4. Sakti: Substratum for energy. 5. Avyakta: As the entire creation is concealed in it in a subtle form. Avyakta: e h f r T R T chHUIMcfcRui I W I J t T ; W F f q fH m f a m i HHHIHJ (Su.Sa. 1 3) Avyakta is responsible for the creation of entire universe and is causeless for its manifestation, characterized by trigunas viz. sattva, rajas and tamas, having eight forms (avyakta, mahat, ahankara and five (5) tanmatras). It is one and one only and the substratum for numerous souls similar to an ocean, which is a substratum for many a number of aquatic mobile and immobile beings such as fish, lotus etc.d K o i t T t i l l dfc f tJTT dfc M I M dfdrHmt TJcfTjrfT?

Sa. 1 4) Mahat tattwa: The first and the foremost basic element manifested from avyakta is known as mahat or buddhi tattwa (intelligence). It is the element which takes the decisions while doing any actions and differentiates between the right and wrong. It possesses all the trigunas. Ahankara:Ahankara: Ahankara is manifested from mahat or buddhi tattva and is also known as egoism. Ahankara also contains trigunas in a state of imbalanced state, so that variation of different individuals can be seen. Depending on the dominance of trigunas, it is of three (3) types viz.1. Sattvika ahankara or vaikarika 2. Rajasika ahankara or taijasa 3. Tamasika ahankara or bhutadi Sattvika ahankara with the initiation of rajasika ahaiikaia leads to the formation of ekadasa indriyas viz. 1. Pahca jhanedriyas srotendriya, twagindriya (sparSanendriya), caksurindriya, rasanendriya and ghranendriya. 2. Pahca karmcndriyas vak, hasta, upastha, payu and pada. 3. Manas. Maulika Siddhanta 511Maulika Siddhanta 511 Tamasika ahahkara with the initiation of rajasika ahahkara leads to the formation of: 1. Panca tanmatras viz. sabda tanmatra, sparsa tanmatra, rupa tanmatra, rasa tanmatra and gandha tanmatra. These five (5) tanmatras possess five visesa gunas and evolve;2. Panca mahabhutas viz. akasa, vayu, tejasjala and prthivi. In this way all the twentyfive (25) tattvas necessary for creation are evolved. Classification of tattvas: According to the Sahkhya philosophy, all the twentyfive (25) tattvas have been classified into four groups as under. 1. Prakrti one(l) 2. Vikrti sixteen (16) 3. Prakrti vikrti seven (7) 4. Na prakrti na vikrti one(l)1. Prakrti: The basic element which manifests the rest of tattvas is known as prakrti or mula prakrti. But it is not being created by any other substance. 2. Vikrti: These types of elements are being created from other tattvas and they are unable to create any other elements. They are sixteen (16) in number viz. eleven (11) indriyas and five (5) mahabhutas. 3. Prakrti vikrti: These types of elements are being created from other tattvas and they are able to create otherelements. They are seven (7) in number viz. mahat, ahahkara and five (5) tanmatras. 4. Na prakrti na vikrti: This tattva cannot be produced any other element and itself is not created by any other, i.e. purusa.As t a vidha Prakr ti 3ToETtT?

Among twentyfour (24) tattvas; avyakta, mahat, ahahkara and five (5) tanmatras are called as astavidha prakrti (causative source) and the rest of sixteen (16) are considered as sodasa vikara (products). 512 Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana512 Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana Similarities Dissimilarities between Prakrti Purusa 3T7T THsETTWT:; rfH8JT TT FTT WToPZFRiT llclUjfa l rrafir f f r r r a w i f t ycj idifafri i TJ T y fru ddi fSiyuii sffayfifuft orneryfifuit Treq miWun Ifa d eifrj 3t ftmmfuiliyyciyMluri tnztwsmfw frr i (Su.

The scientific works written in brief need not contain all the 36 major devices. In other words the number of devices in a scientific treatise depends upon the volume of subject matter. The word tantryukti comprises two constituents viz. tantra and yukti. Tantra means a science orscientific treatise and yukti means a device. Thus tantryukti means devices of composing a scientific treatise. It is not possible to compose a scientific work without tantrayuktis or major devices. These devices are 32 in number according to Kautilya and Susruta (Uttaratantra 65"' chapter), s hereas Maharsi Caraka and Vagbhata enumerated the number of tantrayuktis as 36, in the 12hchapter of Siddhisthana of Caraka Samhita and 50'h chapter of Uttaratantra respectively. Bhattara Haricandra, the commentator on Caraka Samhita has recognized four (4) more devices and enumerated 40 tantrayuktis.

S.No. Uncommon Infrequently used words Meaning 1. Aksi va or Vasira Samudra la vana or common salt 2. Bhadra Vrsabha( bull) 3. Arva Aswa (horse)2. Duhpranitam: It is treatise which is badly composed without aphorisms, commentary and devoid of purpose. 516 Astanga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana 3. Asangatartham: SRTfrlTsf TTtT ilrH UimdoSlH I It is a treatise which is composed with disconnected, inconsistent words or mutually unattached sutrasto leave topics with unassociated is known as asangatartham. 4. Asukharohi padam:It is a treatise which is composed with the words that are hard to pronounce and unpleasant to hear. 5. Viruddham: faW H I M " j a M f o M f c a H , I It is a treatise which is composed with inconsistent with an illustration or contrary to an accepted doctrine or against a rule is said to suffer from viruddha tantra dosa. It is of 3 types viz.a) Drstanta viruddha: Quoting contradictory examples or similes is known as drstanta viruddha. Ex.: "atma is indestructible as it is not created like pot"....in this statement pot given as example as not created can be considered as drstanta viruddha. As pot is artificial and is contrary to other objects.b) Siddhanta viruddha: Contrary to an established or accepted doctrine or principle is known as siddhanta viruddha. Ex.: stating madhura, amla and lavana rasa dravyas aggravates vata and pacifies kapha. c) Samaya viruddha: Violation of rules prescribed by ancient seers is known as samaya viruddha. Ex.: certain customs should be followed since ages for no proper reasoning like not to cut hair on Fridays, don't pull out grass, don't clap with stones.6. Ativistrtam: 3tfrife ri TPT H TSIrlfa dr I It is a treatise which is composed with unnecessary elaboration or discussion beyond a reasonably acceptable limit is known as ativistrta tantra dosa. Ex.: while talking about madhura skandha giving detailed description of all the substances pertaining to madhura skandha, rich in sweetness and issuing from sweetness etc. 7. Atisanksiptam: arfrnFrf refqTiT srai M ividcKyraq.i Maulika Siddhanta 517Maulika Siddhanta 517 It is a treatise in which description or discussion is composed with inadequately understandable and is likely to be ambiguous. Ex.: simply stating triskandha means hetu, lihga and ousadha is not sufficient to understand and which requires explanation. 8. Aprayojanam: HW " rflj lrl nifrl IIt is a treatise which is composed without mentioning the aim, purpose and utility of that scientific work is known as aprayojanam. Ex.: Aprayojanam casya swasthasya swasthya raksanam aturasya vikara prasamanam' maintenance of positive health in a healthy individual and giving treatment to the diseased is the purpose of Ayurveda. Similarly every scientific work should mention the purpose or utility of its contents. If there is no purpose for any knowledge it is considered useless.9. Bhinnakramam:It is a treatise which is composed without adhering to the serial order in which the items are mentioned previously without any valid reason. In other words violation of the sequence of the items mentioned without any specific purpose. Ex.:"sarirajanama dosanam kramenaparamousadham vastirvireko vamanam ' (A.H.Su. I) here the sequence of saririka dosas should be taken as vata, pitta and kapha only and line oftreatment is vasti, virecana and vamana respectively. In the entire text the order of mentioning of tridosas should be vata, pitta and kapha only and should not be altered without any specific reason. 10. Sandigdham:It is a treatise which is composed with doubtful, ambiguous and confused statements is known as sandigdha tantra dosa. Such treatises become unworthy if the contents are not based on sound logical reasoning. Ex.: akaiamrtyu(untimely death). ll.Punaruktam: TJ StR TTTTT "Efrxf "HrFtSft TpfTEZRT ITJ StR TTTTT "Efrxf "HrFtSft TpfTEZRT I It is a treatise which is composed with the descriptions and discussions something over and over again. If the same subject matter is repeated again and again the reader gets bored and do at times will be doubtful about the validity of such descriptions. Hence an ideal scientific work should be devoid of punarukta tantra dosa. 518 Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana 12. Nispramanam: Pimmui HIM ymuRf d I CHIHI12. Nispramanam: Pimmui HIM ymuRf d I CHIHI It is a treatise which is composed without any authority or discussed something baselessly. 13. Asamaptyartham: It is a treatise which is composed with an incomplete discussion and abruptly closes without any conclusion. Such discussions will not provide valid knowledge. 14. Aparthakam Anarthakam: It is a treatise which is composed with senseless meanings. 15.Vyahatam: 4l6 i PT Metal dlcW TWIiUtl 3TTW T f W I4l6 i PT Metal dlcW TWIiUtl 3TTW T f W I It is a treatise which is composed with mutually contradictory statements such as the earlier statements are opposed by the later ones and vice versa.

Ex.: rasa causes brmhana, prinana, vrsya, caksusya and vranahara. Here rasa refers to mamsarasa and the word mamsa is missing. Maulika Siddhanta 527 2. Madhya lopa: HIMMaulika Siddhanta 527 2. Madhya lopa: HIM Ellipses or omission of a word or words in the middle of a statement is known as madhya lopa. Ex.: drava dravya vijnaniya is the name of the chapter mentioned in Astanga Sahgraha by Vagbhata. But actually it should be drava dravyaswarupa vijhaniya. Here the middle word swarupais missing. 3. Anta lopa: 3t Hcf) 4) HIM ilc 3t riM j k i3t Hcf) 4) HIM ilc 3t riM j k i Ellipses or omission of a word or words at the end of a statement is known as anta lopa. Ex.: In the description of raktavaha siras, it is written as "vata raktavaha siras, pitta raktavaha siras, kaphahpunati Here the words rakta vaha siras are missing at the end.

Here simply by hearing the initial words of the statement it is understood completely, though the later words are missing. Ex.: though the food contains all the six tastes, during the process of digestion it is transformed into madhura vipaka initially. By this statement it can be understood the missing words suchas.... Later on it converts into amla and katu vipaka by the influence of pitta and vata respectively. 5. Adimadhyanta lopa:3tlfc5MUIM rl)M) HIM Ellipses or omission of words at all the three places is known as adimadhyanta lopa. This is absolutely an undesirable device, as it is very difficult to understand more likely to err in interpreting. These ellipses can be provided by only a learned person. 6. Upadhi lopa: HIM ilr sl 3tnm JfiHIM ilr sl 3tnm Jfi Arunadatta did not mention upadhi lopa asraya, whereas Sankara Sarma and Bhattara Haricandra quoted in their works. Absence of a condition is known as upadhi lopa. 7. Varnopajanana: Supply of the missing word by the commentators in the later stage is known as varnopajanana. Arunadatta himself quoted that it is identical with vakyasesa type of tantrayukti. 528 Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana 8. Rsi klista: rT ci rtwl i y jttti I8. Rsi klista: rT ci rtwl i y jttti I When a preceptor in a state of inattention or physical inability mispronounces a word, it is received as it is by the student and gains popularity. Ex.: the correct word is 'roma', but due to mispronunciation the word 'loma' has become popular. 9. Tantrasila: d s Dci HIH TTd ehKUi U j f r l : r M f : IAdopting a twofold method of exposition viz. explaining certain topics in briefly and certain topics elaborately (wherever necessary) for the benefit of the readers is known as tantrasila. 10. Tantra samjha: Accepting a specific meaning from several meanings of a technical term by taking the context into account is known as tantra samjha. Ex.: the word 'rasa' may be having several meanings, but in the context of Rasasastra it should be taken as mercury. 11.Prakrtakhya: yi H HIMyi H HIM Interpretation of the words in a scientific treatise according to the context is known as prakrtakhya. Ex.: (a) in the context of war, the word 'saindhava' should be taken to mean a 'horse' and when it is that of medicine; it should be taken to mean 'rock salt'. (b) while describing oudbhida gana dravyas as ksara, ksira, phala, puspa, bhasma etc. in the present context ksira means milky latex and not to mean milk of a cow. 12. Samana tantra pratyaya: SJritil frtl12. Samana tantra pratyaya: SJritil frtl To establish a concept by consulting another scientific work on one's own discipline is known as samana tantra pratyaya. Do at times the author fails to explain the concept and expects the commentator to fill the lacuna. The commentator accomplishes the task with the help of this asraya by referring the scientific works of the same discipline. 13. Paratantra pratyaya: Maulika Siddhanta 529Maulika Siddhanta 529 Taking references from other allied scientific works to explain a topic is known as paratantra pratyaya. Ex.: referring vaisesika darsana for knowing more about sad padarthas mentioned in Ayurveda. 14. Hetu hetuka dharma: tJebUnT HW TT rji H IHetu means a major or potential cause. Hetuka means a minor or incidental cause. To infer dharma after knowing both hetu and hetuka is known as hetu hetuka dharma. In other words when a number of causes are mentioned for an effect, considering the more reasonable and the potent cause is known as hetu hetuka dharma. This asraya helps to draw a line of demarcation between the major and minor causes of an effect.Ex.: pittatlsara leads to raktatisara. Here pitta is the primary cause for raktatlsara and not the atisara. 15. Karya karana dharma:ehl4ehKU Smf' TtT "ET3T cblif'H ' MI ehKlli fal AI chKUI'H ' MI T cbl4H. I rf5T dMtxfcKlli I To speak of an effect as a cause and cause as an effect in a secondary sense is known as karya karana dharma. Ex.: rogas do at times called as dosas and vice versa. 16. Adyanta viparyaya:To alter the sequence of the arrangement of the chapters or subject matter contrary to previous one or the original order according to pratijha vakya for valid reasons is known as adyanta viparyaya. 17. Sabdanyatwa:h ih M i l l i j y i c d cjuf yf d yil d: I To recommend or make a note of identical scientific terms is known as sabdanyatwa. These synonyms will be helpful for clear understanding of a scientific work without any ambiguity. Ex.: papma, jwara, vyadhi, vikara, duhkha, amaya, yaksma, atanka, gada, badha etc. are the synonyms for roga. 18. Pratyaya dharma: TJrERTtnrf 'Efr g t tlMfuMfrim Ul r Hf r H oiJMfc il IKeeping the real cause of the effect hidden and giving importance to the insignificant cause is known as pratyaya dharma. 530 Astaiiga Hrdayam: Sutra sthana Ex: though prajhaparadha is the real cause for unmada, giving undue importance to the insignificant cause of invasion of pisacas. 19. Upanaya: H I M S J W I H AHI rycMUiyM fl Mr) IUpanaya is to draw near or closer. That means deliberating the allied subject matter in introducing a major topic. Ex.: after introducing the topic on the quantity of food (matrahara adhyaya), begins to discuss about the disease condition' visucika1, resulting from excessive intake of food. 20. Sambhava: T l l d l H IM yehiu igT ' f t t J l t iHMHfcta "UMeh l fleh H yil OT ot( I 1 rl IMentioning the major topics or subject matter briefly, what the author intended to discuss in detail in his work is known as sambhava arthasraya. Ex.: mentioning of "kayabalagraha....jaravrsan" reveals that the author intended to explain in detail about all the 8 branches of Ayurveda in his work. 21. Vibhava: Since Arunadatta's manuscript is mutilated after the word bhangya it is not possible to formulate a precise idea about vibhava.
